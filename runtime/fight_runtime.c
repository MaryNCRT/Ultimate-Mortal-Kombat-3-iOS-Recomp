/*
 * fight_runtime.c -- what the fight engine needs from outside itself.
 *
 * `decomp/gamecode/logic` is complete and links against two things it does
 * not contain:
 *
 *   1. **Its data.** ~1,100 tables -- special-move lists, animation scripts,
 *      reaction and AI tables -- extracted from the user's binary at build time
 *      by `tools/logic_tables.py` into `logic_tables.c` in the build directory.
 *      That file also holds zero storage for the engine's runtime state
 *      (`umk3_common_G`, `umk3_common_Plyr` ...), because tables point into it.
 *
 *   2. **Its slot pointers.** The binary reaches every global through a
 *      literal-pool word holding the global's address, and the decompiled C
 *      keeps that shape: `char *Plyr`, `GAMESTATE *G`, `MK3THREAD *mytc`. This
 *      file defines those pointers and aims them at the storage above.
 *
 * Every address a slot is given here was read from the binary: the slot's own
 * address is in the comment on the extern that declares it, and its contents
 * are what `tools/logic_tables.py --report` and the symbol table say. They are
 * repeated below so this file can be checked without the decompiled sources.
 *
 * ## Shared with the front end
 *
 * `G`, `H`, `MKEventQueue` and `RoundParam` belong to the front end as well,
 * and `runtime/gamecode_globals.c` defines them when the front end is linked
 * (`UMK3_SHELL`). There they start out NULL or pointing at the front end's own
 * copy, so `fight_runtime_init` re-aims them at the one storage the tables
 * also point into. A fight that ran on two copies of `G` -- the switch words
 * `swtab` writes through and the ones `TranslateJoybits` reads -- would not
 * take input, and would give no other sign of why.
