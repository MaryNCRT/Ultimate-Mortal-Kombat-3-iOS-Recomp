 * The platform layer's entire interface.

 * Everything iOS-specific in the original lives behind this. The point of

 * not auditing the engine.
 *
 * Backends:
 *   win32_gl.c   Win32 + WGL. No dependencies, builds with the toolchain that
 *                is already here. This is what the vertical slice uses.
 *   sdl_gl.c     SDL2. The portable path, and the reason the interface is
 *                shaped this way rather than exposing HWND. Default off
 *                Windows; -DUMK3_BACKEND=sdl2 selects it on Windows too.
