/* ------------------------------------------------------------ LIME_LoadScene
 *
 * armv6 0x00081da0, 1508 bytes.  **Structurally complete -- it maps SCENEINFO.**
 *
 * The entry point for loading anything the renderer draws. It is the largest
 * function in lime/common and the one that finally explains the naming
 * convention in `res/`.
 *
 * ## A scene is a FAMILY of files, derived by suffix replacement
 *
 * The caller passes one name ending in `.scene`. The function then builds its
 * siblings by overwriting the last six characters:
 *
 *      bl       strlen
 *      sub      fp, sl, #6          ; len - 6, i.e. the start of ".scene"
 *      bl       strcpy              ; copy the name into a stack buffer
 *      add      r0, r0, fp          ; point at the suffix
 *      mov      r2, #8              ; ...or #9
 *      bl       memcpy              ; overwrite it
 *
 * `#6` is exactly the length of `.scene`. The replacements are **8 and 9 bytes
 * including the terminator**, so seven- and eight-character suffixes -- and the
 * shipped data has precisely two of each length alongside every `.scene`:
 *
 * | bytes | suffix | contents |
 * |---:|---|---|
 * | 8 | `.events` | effect tracks |
 * | 9 | `.meshset` | geometry |
 * | 9 | `.offsets` | present for some scenes only |
 *
 * That is why `res/` is full of triples and quadruples sharing a stem --
 * `ANIMALITY_HAWK.scene`, `.meshset`, `.events`, `.offsets`. **There is no
 * index and no manifest**: the relationship between those files is this
 * arithmetic, and nothing else. A repacker that renames one file breaks the
 * set silently.
 *
 * The `.offsets` load is guarded by a null check, and **the shipped data agrees
 * with that exactly**. Counted in `res/`:
 *
 *      .scene     547
 *      .events    545       <- essentially one per scene
 *      .meshset   605       <- more; some are loaded without a scene
 *      .offsets    74       <- 474 of the 547 scenes have none
 *
 * A near-1:1 ratio for `.events` and a small minority for `.offsets` is
 * precisely the shape the code predicts: one unconditional load, one guarded.
 * The prediction came from the disassembly and the count came from the files,
 * and they were not compared until after both were written down.
 *
 * ## Scenes are cached and shared
 *
 * The first thing it does is `LIME_GetSceneFromFilename`, and on a hit it
 * touches `+0x40` and returns the existing pointer. On a miss it calls
 * `AddScene` to register the new one. So **two scenes naming the same file get
 * the same SCENEINFO**, and a port that reloads per use will both waste memory
 * and break whatever `+0x40` is counting.
 *
 * ## The field map
 *
 * This function writes more of SCENEINFO than everything else recovered so far
 * combined. Offsets that are *set here* and their source:
 *
 * ```
 *   +0x40   from the caller (also written to +0x78)
 *   +0x44   word 1 of a header      (with +0x48, +0x4c: count / data / alloc)
 *   +0x48   word 0 of that header
 *   +0x4c   limeMalloc sized from +0x44 and +0x48
 *   +0x54   \
 *   +0x58    >  three words from one sibling file, then the buffer is freed
 *   +0x5c   /
 *   +0x60   zero
 *   +0x64   \
 *   +0x68    \  four words from another sibling, then freed
 *   +0x6c    /
 *   +0x70   /
 *   +0x74   the cached-scene pointer
 *   +0x80   LIME_LoadMeshSet result   <-- the geometry
 *   +0x84   LIME_LoadEvents result    <-- the effect tracks
 * ```
 *
 * **`+0x80` confirms RenderDebugCube independently.** That function reads
 * `scene->[0x80]` and hands it to LIME_LoadMeshSetTextures; here is the store
 * that puts the meshset there. Two unrelated functions, same offset, same
 * meaning -- which is the standard this project holds field identifications to.
 *
 * `+0x44` was already known as `count2`, the modulus
 * LIME_TriggerEventsFromScene takes frame numbers against. Seeing it filled
 * from a file header here closes that loop: the modulus is the scene's own
 * frame count, read from disk.
 *
 * The body is left as the load sequence rather than transcribed instruction by
 * instruction. The control flow around the optional files is a chain of
 * null-guards whose exact ordering does not change the outcome, and writing it
 * out precisely would add length without adding fact.

 * here and FlushTranspMeshList draws the whole batch afterwards.
 *
 * ## The record is 48 bytes, and the compiler says so twice

 *      sub  r3, r3, r4, lsl #4     ; minus index * 16   ->  index * 48
 *
 * One multiply turned into two shifts and a subtract, the same trick
 * LIME_LoadBones uses. FlushTranspMeshList walks the identical array with a
 * plain `add r6, r6, #0x30`, so both sides agree on 0x30.
 *
 * ```
 *   +0x00   two words copied from the SCENENODE
 *   +0x04     (a byte at +0x05 is read back as a flag when flushing)
 *   +0x08   the QSTMATRIX, 32 bytes, copied verbatim by two ldm/stm pairs
 *   +0x28   MESHSETINFO *
 *   +0x2c   the fifth argument
 * ```
 *
 * ## Overflowing the list HANGS the game
 *
 * This is the part worth stopping on:
 *
 *      add   r3, r4, #1
 *      cmp   r3, #0xff
 *      str   r3, [r5]
 *      pople {r4, r5, r7, pc}      ; <= 255: return normally
 *      b     #0x81b20              ; otherwise branch to ITSELF
 *
 * `b #0x81b20` is at address `0x81b20`. **It is an unconditional branch to its
 * own address** -- an infinite loop with interrupts still on. The 256th
 * transparent mesh in a frame does not wrap, does not drop, and does not
 * crash. It locks the game solid.
 *
 * That is almost certainly a debug assert whose reporting half was stripped in
 * the retail build, exactly like `LIME_printf` and `RenderAxesLines` -- the
 * check survived and the message did not. The effect on a shipped device is the
 * same either way.
 *
 * **For the port**: the limit is 255 per frame and it must be enforced
 * somewhere visible. A widescreen or higher-resolution port that draws more of
 * a stage at once moves closer to this ceiling, not further from it, so
 * silently raising the array size is the right fix and dropping the check is
 * not -- if it can be hit, it needs to be seen.

 *
 *      bl  _limeEnableAlphaBlending_Additive

 *
 * **Additive blending with depth writes off** -- and that single choice
 * explains the whole design. Additive blending is commutative: `a + b + c`
 * gives the same pixel in any order. So the list is drawn **in insertion order
 * with no depth sort anywhere**, because it does not need one.
 *
 * This is why a fixed 255-entry array with no ordering is adequate rather than
 * naive. It is also the thing most likely to be "improved" by mistake in a
 * port: adding a back-to-front sort costs time and changes nothing, while
 * switching to standard alpha blending to make smoke look denser makes the
 * result **order-dependent** and the absence of a sort becomes a real bug.
 *
 * Depth *testing* is left on -- only writes are disabled -- so transparent
 * meshes are still occluded by opaque geometry but never occlude each other.
 *
 * ## Per item
 *
 * Push the matrix stack, expand the stored QST through
 * `ConvertQSTMatrixtoPCMatrix` -- reading from **`item + 8`**, which confirms
 * the offset AddToTranspMeshList writes it to -- check the flag byte at
 * `item + 5`, call `LIME_RenderMesh`, then `LIME_PopMatrix(1)`.
 *
 * One push and one pop per item, so a mesh that returns early still leaves the
 * stack balanced.
 *
 * The branch structure around the flag byte and the two texture pointers is not
 * transcribed; the loop body has several early exits whose ordering does not
 * change what is drawn, and the body below leaves them out rather than guess
 * their order.

 *
 * armv6 0x000827e0, 1896 bytes.  **Structurally complete.**
 *
 * Draws a whole scene for one frame. The largest function in this file, and it
 * differs from LIME_RenderSceneOverrideTextures in one substantial way: **it
 * interpolates between two keys, and the override version does not.**
 *
 * ## Two frames, two palette matrices, one blend
 *
 *      ldrh r0, [r6, #6]            ; key A's palette index
 *      bl   GetMatrixFromPalette
 *      ldrh r0, [r1, #6]            ; key B's
 *      bl   GetMatrixFromPalette
 *      bl   LerpQSTMatrix
 *
 * `__modsi3` is called **twice** in the prologue -- once per frame -- and the
 * stream is read at two offsets (`ldrh r3, [r3, r2]` and `ldrh r3, [ip, r2]`).
 * So the scene walks to the key for this frame and the key for the next, pulls
 * a QST matrix for each out of the palette, and blends them.
 *
 * That names a field the override path never touches: **`SCENENODEKEY+0x06` is
 * a palette index**, a `uint16` handed straight to GetMatrixFromPalette. The
 * 8-byte key is therefore alpha, mesh index, and palette index -- everything a
 * node needs for one keyframe, in eight bytes.
 *
 * `LerpQSTMatrix` re-quantises to `int16` at every element (see LIMEDS_Misc.c),
 * so the quantisation is part of how scene animation looks. A port that blends
 * in float throughout produces visibly smoother motion than the original, which
 * sounds like an improvement and is a behaviour change.
 *
 * ## Transparent nodes are deferred, not drawn
 *
 * Nodes needing blending go to `AddToTranspMeshList` instead of being drawn
 * here, which is what fills the list `FlushTranspMeshList` later empties. The
 * opaque state is restored on both exits, exactly as in the override version.
 *
 * ## The EVENT test again
 *
 * `cmp r3, #0x45` on the mesh name, same as the override path -- markers are
 * skipped rather than drawn. Two independent functions carrying the same
 * convention.
 *
 * ## What is not written out
 *
 * The body below covers the walk, the two-key blend and the transparent
 * deferral. It does **not** transcribe the flag handling around `LIME_printf`
 * and the second `cmp ip, #1` in the prologue: those select between paths that
 * were not traced, and the argument they test is not identified. Guessing which
 * branch a flag selects is how the previous attempt at this file's other
 * renderer went wrong.

/* ------------------------------------------- LIME_RenderSceneOverrideTextures
 *
 * armv7 0x0005f4d4, 364 bytes.
 *
 * The same walk with a caller-supplied texture per mesh. This is how one scene
 * asset serves several characters or several palettes.
 *
 * ## Its argument list is not the same shape as LIME_RenderScene
 *
 *      mov  r8, r0            ; arg1 IS the scene here
 *      str  r1, [sp, #4]      ; arg2, kept for the loop
 *      mov  r0, r2            ; arg3 is the frame
 *      blx  ___modsi3
 *
 * So the scene comes first and the frame is still third. And arg2 is not one
 * texture but a TABLE of them, indexed by the same byte that selects the mesh:
 *
 *      ldr   r3, [sp, #4]           ; arg2
 *      ldr.w r2, [r3, r6, lsl #2]   ; textures[meshIndex]
 *      bl    _LIME_RenderMesh
 *
 * An earlier version of this file declared it as
 * `(scene, frame, TEXTURE *replacement, flags)` and passed a single texture.
 * See docs/RENDERSCENE-SIGNATURE.md for how the real list was measured.
 *
 * ## The palette index comes from the KEY, not from the frame
 *
 *      ldrh r0, [r5, #6]            ; key->paletteIndex
 *      bl   _GetMatrixFromPalette
 *
 * The previous body passed the frame number. That agrees whenever a scene lays
 * its keys out one per frame in order -- which is exactly the scene a casual
 * test would build, and wrong for every scene that reuses a pose. The whole
 * point of the two-level table is that poses repeat.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not written out
 *
 * A global at `0x00112222 + pc` gates an alternate path at 0x5f608, and the
 * alpha test here is against **1.0f** where LIME_RenderScene uses 0.97.
 * Neither is transcribed further, because neither was followed.
 */
/* armv7 0x0005f4d4, transcribed whole. What the armv6 reading had left
 * open:
 *
 *   - the gate at 0x5f53e is _SceneRenderAlwaysTrans: when it is set (the
 *     FIGHT / FINISH HIM overlay sets it around this one call), every node
 *     is drawn with basic alpha blending -- the texture's own alpha;
 *   - a node whose key alpha is 0 is skipped, one at exactly 1.0 restores the
 *     opaque state first; nothing calls glColor4f;
 *   - the mesh is found BY NAME (LIME_FindMeshByName on the key's mesh's
 *     name), and the texture is textures[that index];
 *   - a node with no keys is skipped without restoring state. */
