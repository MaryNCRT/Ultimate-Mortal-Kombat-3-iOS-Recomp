/*
 * lime/common — the engine's own global state.
 *
 * Every object here has a real symbol in the retail binary. They are gathered
 * into one translation unit because the original spread them across the .cpp
 * files that used them, and a decompilation that mirrors that would need each
 * file to both declare and define them — which is how you end up with two
 * definitions and a link error nobody can place.
 *
 * **These are engine data, not runtime data.** Anything the platform provides
 * (limeLoadFile, limeMalloc, the GL entry points) is deliberately NOT here;
 * those belong to runtime/ and are only declared in lime.h.
 *
 * Sizes and initial values are stated only where the disassembly gives them.
 * Where it does not, the object is defined at its natural size and left zeroed,
 * which is what __DATA,__common means anyway.
