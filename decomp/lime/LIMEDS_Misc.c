 * obviously broken, which is the worst kind of wrong.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------ LerpQSTMatrix
 *
 * armv6 0x0007fc44, 344 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Blends two QST matrices by `t`, and it is fully unrolled -- no loop, ten
 * elements written one after another.
 *
 * ## It treats the two halves differently
 *
 * ```
 *   ldrsh / strh   0x00 0x02 0x04 0x06        the quaternion, as int16
 *   vldr  / vstr   0x08 0x0c 0x10 0x14 0x18 0x1c   scale and translation, float
 * ```
 *
 * Four plus six, exactly matching QSTMATRIX. **So the re-quantisation applies
 * to the quaternion only** -- the scale and translation are blended in float and
 * stay float. This file used to say "re-quantised to int16 at every element",
 * which was true of the half it had looked at and wrong about the rest.
 *
 * The quaternion round-trip is real and worth reproducing: `ldrsh` up,
 * `vcvt.f32.s32`, the blend, `vcvt.s32.f32` and `strh` back down, per element.
 * A port that keeps the whole thing in float produces visibly smoother rotation
 * than the original, which sounds like an improvement and is a behaviour change.
 *
 * ## The blend
 *
 *      vsub.f32 s14, s15, s12       ; 1 - t, once, before the elements
 *      vmul.f32 s15, s12, s15       ; t * b
 *      vmla.f32 s15, s13, s14       ; + a * (1 - t)
 *
 * So `out = b*t + a*(1-t)`, which means **`t = 0` yields `a`** -- the same
 * direction as LerpVector3 and GetSlerpedQ, and the third function in this
 * engine to blend that way round.

/* ------------------------------------------------- ConvertQSTMatrixtoPCMatrix
 *
 * armv6 0x0007fd90, 416 bytes.  **Not fully decompiled.**
 *
 * Expands a QST matrix into the float 4x4 the renderer uses.
 *
 * What is established: it reads four `int16` from +0x00 through +0x06, scales
 * each by **1/32767**, and works in **double** -- `vcvt.f64.s32`, `vmul.f64` --
 * before narrowing. The immediate squaring (`vmul.f64 d1, d4, d4`) is the
 * quaternion-to-matrix expansion, the same shape as `GetMFromQuat2` in
 * RenderSkinned.cpp but at higher precision.
 *
 * Computing in double here is consistent with the rest of the engine's
 * accuracy-sensitive code -- `CreatePerspectiveMatrix` and `NormaliseLDirs` do
 * the same and narrow once at the end.
 *
 * ## The scale and translation, settled
 *
 * The rotation is the textbook expansion -- `m[0] = 1 - 2y² - 2z²`,
 * `m[1] = 2xy + 2wz`, and so on -- computed in double and narrowed once. Then
 * each **row** is multiplied by a float read from the source:
 *
 *      vldr   s15, [r0, #0x08]   ; multiplies m[0], m[1], m[2]
 *      vldr   s15, [r0, #0x0c]   ; multiplies m[4], m[5], m[6]
 *      vldr   s15, [r0, #0x10]   ; multiplies m[8], m[9], m[10]
 *
 * So the S in QST is a **per-axis scale applied to rows, not a uniform
 * factor**, and those three fields are `float` rather than the fixed point the
 * quaternion uses. Scaling rows rather than columns is what makes it a scale in
 * the object's own frame.
 *
 * The translation is copied **verbatim**, as words with no conversion:
 *
 *      ldr r3, [r0, #0x14] -> str r3, [r1, #0x30]
 *      ldr r3, [r0, #0x18] -> str r3, [r1, #0x34]
 *      ldr r3, [r0, #0x1c] -> str r3, [r1, #0x38]
 *      mov r3, #0x3f800000 -> str r3, [r1, #0x3c]     ; 1.0f
 *
 * ## And that lands it in GL's layout
 *
 * `m[12]`, `m[13]`, `m[14]` with `1.0f` at `m[15]` is exactly where
 * `glMultMatrixf` expects a translation. So this result is **GL-ready and needs
 * no transpose** -- which is why FlushTranspMeshList and
 * LIME_RenderSceneOverrideTextures hand it straight to GL.
 *
 * Contrast ConvertDSMatrixtoPCMatrix in this same file, which writes explicit
 * zeros at `+0x0c` and `+0x1c` and produces the row-major form that does need
 * transposing. Two conversion functions, two conventions, one file. The rule
 * this project records holds: matrices built from a rotation here arrive
 * GL-ready, and matrices converted from the older fixed-point formats do not.

 * armv6 0x0007ff84, 376 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * This is **gluLookAt**, written out by hand. The engine never links GLU, so
 * the view matrix is built here and this is the only place the camera basis
 * exists.
 *
 * **It takes nine floats, not three vectors.** The prologue does
 * `stm sp, {r0, r1, r2}` and then immediately reads them back with `vldr` --
 * the first three arguments are float bit patterns arriving in core registers
 * under the soft-float ABI, not pointers. The other six come off the caller
 * stack at +0x7c through +0x90. So the grouping into eye, target and up below
 * is a reading of how they are used, not of how they are declared:
 *
 *      vsub.f32 s8, s22, s16       arg0 - arg3
 *      vsub.f32 s7, s23, s17       arg1 - arg4
 *      vsub.f32 s6, s24, s18       arg2 - arg5
 *
 * -- three componentwise subtractions in a row is a vector difference, which
 * makes 0..2 and 3..5 two points, and 6..8 the remaining direction.
 *
 * The rest is unmistakable: sum the squares, `vsqrt.f32`, divide. The divides
 * are `vdivne`, predicated on the length compare, so **a zero length silently
 * leaves the vector unnormalised rather than producing NaN**. That is worth
 * reproducing exactly; a port that divides unconditionally turns a degenerate
 * camera into a black screen instead of a stuck one.
 *
 * Note it does **not** call `Normalise` or `Len` from limeVector.cpp even
 * though both exist -- the normalisation and the cross product are inlined
 * here. There is no cross-product symbol anywhere in the binary, so every
 * cross product in this engine is written out by hand at its use site.
 *
 * The eye position is negated up front (`vneg.f32` on all three) and used at
 * the very end, which gives away the whole structure:
 *
 *      glMultMatrixf(basis);
 *      glTranslatef(-eye.x, -eye.y, -eye.z);
 *
 * -- rotate the world into the camera, then move it back. Standard view
 * matrix construction.
 *
 * **The basis is written down columns, not across rows.** The three components
 * of the first vector go to +0x00, +0x10 and +0x20 of the matrix; the second
 * to +0x04, +0x14, +0x24. Writing a basis transposed *is* inverting it for a
 * pure rotation, which is exactly what a view matrix needs -- so the matrix
 * arrives at glMultMatrixf already in the layout GL wants, and needs no
 * transpose.
 *
 * That resolves the convention question this file raises twice elsewhere.
 * ConvertDSMatrixtoPCMatrix produces row-major and needs transposing; this one
 * and LIMEDS_SetObjectOrientation do not. The rule is not per-function
 * whim -- **matrices built from basis vectors here are stored GL-ready, and
 * matrices converted from the old fixed-point formats are not.**
 *
 * The remaining fields are written as literal zeros (+0x0c, +0x1c, +0x2c for
 * the fourth column, +0x30, +0x34, +0x38 for the bottom row) with 1.0f at
 * +0x3c, so the translation genuinely is not in the matrix -- it is the
 * glTranslatef that follows.
 *
 * Only two normalised vectors are stored, at +0x00/+0x10/+0x20 and
 * +0x04/+0x14/+0x24. The third column of the basis is among the zeroed slots.
 * That is unusual enough to flag rather than quietly complete: it is recorded
 * as written, and the third basis vector is left out rather than invented.
