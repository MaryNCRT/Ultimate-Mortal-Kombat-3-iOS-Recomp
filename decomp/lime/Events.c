 * lime/common/Events.cpp -- the runtime event manager.
 *
 * Recovered from the armv6 slice. Addresses below are armv6.
 *
 * The `.events` file format is documented in docs/EVENTS-FORMAT.md; this is
 * the code that plays those tracks back. The two meet at FindEventOffsets,
 * which walks tracks at the 216-byte in-memory stride the format doc derived
 * from the loader.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The event pool
 *
 * A fixed array, not a list: **192 slots of 248 bytes each**, 47,616 bytes
 * total. Every function here that touches it walks from a global base in
 * 0xF8-byte steps and stops after 0xBA00 bytes, and 0xC0 * 0xF8 == 0xBA00
 * exactly.
 *
 * That the pool is fixed matters for a port: there is no allocation on the
 * event path at all, and GetFreeEvent returning -1 is the only failure mode.
 *
 * Fields identified so far, as offsets into a slot:
 *
 *      +0x00   int   state -- 0 is free, > 0 is live, NEGATIVE is dying
 *                    (a killed event starts at -2 and is counted UP to zero
 *                     by LIME_UpdateEvents; see that function)
 *      +0x14   SCENEEVENTTRACK *track
 *      +0x3c   long  group id
 *      +0xa4   float (set together with +0xe4 when an event is killed)
 *      +0xe4   float

/* ----------------------------------------------------------- LIME_UpdateEvents
 *
 * armv6 0x000e9238, 452 bytes.  **Rewritten -- the first version was wrong.**
 *
 * Ticks every slot in the event pool once per frame.
 *
 * ## What the first version got wrong, and how it was caught
 *
 * An earlier pass read `beq #0xe937c` on the repeat counter as "nothing to do,
 * go to the next slot". It is the opposite: that branch is where an event whose
 * counters have run out **kills itself**. The code there is
 *
 *      mvn  r3, #1             ; -2
 *      str  r3, [r4]           ; state = -2
 *      str  r3, [r4, #0xa4]    ; the same two float fields
 *      str  r3, [r4, #0xe4]    ; KillAlleventsWithGroup writes
 *
 * -- the identical kill signature. So the version written first left finished
 * effects alive forever, and read the whole function inside out.
 *
 * It was caught by `tests/test_events_diff.c` on its first run: a live event
 * with no repeats left stayed at state 3 in the clean C while the original took
 * it to -2. Nothing about that is visible by reading; it took running both.
 *
 * ## The real shape
 *
 * Per slot, in order:
 *
 *  - **state 0** -- free, skip.
 *  - **state < 0** -- dying. Count UP toward zero and skip. That part of the
 *    first version was right: -2 buys a two-frame grace period before the slot
 *    is handed out again.
 *  - **a delay at +0x38** -- decremented, clamped at zero, and while it is still
 *    positive the slot is skipped entirely. A start delay.
 *  - **the frame cursor at +0x04** is truncated to an integer and stored at
 *    +0x08. If it differs from the previous frame at +0x0c, the scene's event
 *    tracks fire through `LIME_TriggerEventsFromScene`, which is handed the
 *    scene at +0x10, the track block at +0x68, and four more fields.
 *    **Events fire on a frame CHANGE, not once per tick** -- so a slowed or
 *    paused cursor does not re-trigger, and a port that fires per tick will
 *    emit duplicates at low speed.
 *  - **+0x0c is then set to +0x08**, remembering the frame just handled.
 *
 * ## Two counters, then death
 *
 * When the frame reaches `scene->count2 - 1` the event has run its length, and
 * three things can happen:
 *
 * | condition | what happens |
 * |---|---|
 * | `+0x2c` non-zero | rewind: cursor and both frame fields reset to `count2 - 1`; the counter decrements unless it is **-1**, which loops forever |
 * | `+0x2c` zero, `+0x30` non-zero | a second pass: cursor steps back by the frame count and `+0x30` decrements while positive |
 * | both zero | **state = -2** and the two float fields are written -- the event kills itself |
 *
 * Two independent counters rather than one is not what the first reading
 * assumed, and it is the difference between an effect that ends and one that
 * never does.
 *
 * ## The pool geometry, unchanged
 *
 * The walk steps `#0xf8` and ends at a sentinel of `base + 0xb900 + 8`, which
 * is `0xBA00` minus one slot -- 192 slots of 248 bytes, confirmed a third time
 * from the consumer side.
 *
 * **Indexed, not stepped by 0xf8.** `sizeof(EVENT)` is 256 on a 64-bit host
 * because an ARM pointer is 4 bytes and ours is 8. Walking a real C array with
 * the original's byte stride runs off the end -- it did, with a segfault. A
 * hard-coded stride is correct only for memory the engine treats as raw bytes.
 *
 * ## What is still not written out
 *
 * The four extra arguments passed to LIME_TriggerEventsFromScene (+0x40, +0x60,
 * +0x48, +0xe8, +0xec) are named by offset here rather than given meanings, and
 * the exact float arithmetic on the rewind path -- which mixes a subtraction of
 * the frame count with an addition of the step at +0x28 -- is described above
 * rather than transcribed. Both are visible in the disassembly and neither was
 * traced to a confident conclusion.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------ LIME_PlayFBXAtPos
 *
 * armv6 0x000e8ddc, 188 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Fires a one-off effect at a position, without a scene to drive it.
 *
 * The whole function is **a synthetic SCENEEVENTTRACK built in a static
 * buffer**, then handed to LIME_TriggerEventFromSceneH. Nothing is allocated
 * and nothing is freed -- the same scratch track is overwritten on every call,
 * which means **this is not re-entrant and cannot be called from two places in
 * one frame** without the second clobbering the first. In a single-threaded
 * frame loop that is fine, and it is the kind of shortcut that stops being fine
 * the moment a port adds a worker thread.
 *
 * "FBX" is the engine's own word for an effect: the `.events` files are full of
 * names like `smokeparticle fbx` and `bomblets fbx`.
 *
 * ## What a default track looks like
 *
 * This is the most useful thing here -- it is a documented set of neutral
 * values for every field that matters:
 *
 * ```
 *   +0x08  +0x0c  +0x10  +0x14   1.0f   (four scale or colour terms)
 *   +0xc4                        1.0f
 *   +0x1c  +0x20  +0x24          0      (a vector, zeroed)
 *   +0x70  +0x78  +0x7c          0
 *   +0xd0                        -1     <- no instance limit
 *   matrix                       identity, via limeMatrixLoadIdentity
 * ```
 *
 * **`+0xd0` set to -1 is the interesting one.** LIME_TriggerEventFromSceneH
 * reads that same field, compares it against `CountEventsMatching`, and refuses
 * to spawn when the count has reached it -- so `+0xd0` is a **cap on how many
 * copies of a track may run at once**, and -1 disables the cap. A one-shot
 * effect fired by hand should never be throttled, so PlayFBXAtPos opts out.
 *
 * Two independent functions, one field, consistent meaning. That is the
 * standard this project holds field identifications to, and it is met here.
 */
/* **The forwarding call was wrong, and this is what fixed it.** The argument
 * list below was written shifted: `NULL` stood where the CALLER'S MATRIX goes,
 * everything after it moved up one, and `t->scene` stood where the caller's
 * scene goes -- a field this function never writes. The binary is plain about
 * all of it:
 *
 *      mov   fp, r2                ; the scene, kept across the body
 *      ...
 *      movs  r3, #1                ; a6 is 1, not 0
 *      mov   r0, fp                ; scene := the third argument
 *      mov   r1, r4                ; track := the scratch track
 *      mov   r2, r6                ; m1    := the scratch matrix
 *      ldr   r3, [sp, #0x1c]       ; m2    := the FIRST argument
 *      str.w r8, [sp]              ; a4    := the second
 *      str   sl, [sp, #0xc]        ; a7    := the fourth
 *
 * Nothing stores to `[r4, #4]` anywhere in the body, so `t->scene` was never
 * set and the old call passed whatever the previous caller left there.
 *
 * The parameters are typed for what the call sites pass -- a matrix and a
 * scene, in GameCode.c and Blood.c -- rather than as the four words the
 * registers happen to hold. `tools/protos.py` is what put the two side by
 * side.

/* ------------------------------------------------- LIME_TriggerEventFromSceneH
 *
 * armv6 0x000e8afc, 736 bytes.  **Structurally complete.**
 *
 * The spawn path every other trigger in this file funnels into.
 *
 * ## Two gates before a slot is used
 *
 * ```
 *      bl    GetFreeEvent
 *      cmn   r0, #1
 *      beq   <give up>              ; pool full -> silently do nothing
 *
 *      ldr   r3, [r6, #0xd0]        ; the track's instance cap
 *      cmn   r3, #1
 *      beq   <skip the check>       ; -1 means unlimited
 *      bl    CountEventsMatching
 *      cmp   r0, r3
 *      bge   <give up>              ; already at the cap
 * ```
 *
 * So a track carries **its own limit on simultaneous copies**, checked by
 * counting live events that match it rather than by a per-track counter. That
 * is O(pool) per spawn -- 192 slots -- which is cheap enough at these numbers
 * and, more importantly, cannot drift out of sync the way a counter can when
 * events are freed by the deferred countdown in LIME_UpdateEvents.
 *
 * **Both failures are silent.** A full pool and an exceeded cap both just
 * return. Effects thin out under load instead of the game misbehaving, which is
 * the right call for a fighting game and a thing a port must not "fix" into an
 * error.
 *
 * `+0x7c` non-zero diverts to a separate path early on; it is the flag
 * LIME_PlayFBXAtPos explicitly clears.
 *
 * ## There is only one array
 *
 *      lsl r1, r4, #8              ; index * 256
 *      sub sl, r1, r4, lsl #3      ; minus index * 8  ->  index * 248
 *
 * An earlier pass read the two shifts as two parallel arrays addressed from the
 * same index. They are one **stride**, computed the way this engine computes
 * every stride: 248 as `256 - 8`, exactly as `LIME_LoadBones` builds 56 and
 * `AddToTranspMeshList` builds 48. The slot pointer is that offset added to the
 * pool base, and nothing else is indexed.
 *
 * ## The spawn writes 23 fields
 *
 * ```
 *   +0x0c +0x10 +0x14              cursor, scene, track
 *   +0x28 +0x2c +0x30 +0x34 +0x38  step, repeat, repeat2, ?, delay
 *   +0x3c +0x40 +0x44 +0x48 +0x4c  group and four caller arguments
 *   +0x50 +0x54 +0x58 +0x5c +0x60  a five-word block, two from one argument
 *   +0x64                          a register held across the whole prologue
 *   +0xe8 +0xec                    the last two caller arguments
 *   +0xf0 +0xf4                    IsWhirlwindScene(scene), and a global
 * ```
 *
 * `+0xf0` is the return of **`IsWhirlwindScene`**, called on the scene before
 * anything is written. So an event records at spawn whether its scene is a
 * whirlwind, and `KillIllegalWhirlwinds` and `IsOnWWFrame` elsewhere in this
 * file are the consumers -- three functions around one special case, which is
 * more attention than any other effect in the engine gets.
 *
 * The body below sets the fields whose meaning is established elsewhere in this
 * file and leaves the rest addressed by offset. Naming them from this one
 * function would be naming them from a single sighting, which is not the
 * standard used here.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------ LIME_LoadEvents
 *
 * armv6 0x000e8484, 1064 bytes.  **Structurally complete.**
 *
 * Reads a `.events` file into the SCENEEVENTTRACK array that
 * LIME_TriggerEventFromSceneH later spawns from.
 *
 * ## 216 bytes per track, spelled out in four instructions
 *
 * The allocation is the clearest confirmation of the record size this file has:
 *
 *      lsl  r1, r3, #5             ; count * 32
 *      sub  r1, r1, r3, lsl #3     ; minus count * 8   -> count * 24
 *      lsl  r3, r1, #3             ; that * 8          -> count * 192
 *      add  r1, r1, r3             ; 24 + 192          -> count * 216
 *
 * **216**, exactly the stride `FindEventOffsets` and `LIME_FreeEvents` step by.
 * Three functions, one number, arrived at three different ways -- the allocator
 * builds it out of shifts, and the two walkers use it as a literal.
 *
 * (Note this is *not* the 248-byte figure. 248 is the size of a live EVENT slot
 * in the runtime pool; 216 is the size of a SCENEEVENTTRACK loaded from disk.
 * They are different structures and the project has confused them before.)
 *
 * ## Names are uppercased at load, in a 64-byte field
 *
 *      ldrb   r2, [r4, r3]
 *      sub    r3, r2, #0x61        ; - 'a'
 *      uxtb   r3, r3
 *      cmp    r3, #0x19            ; <= 25, i.e. was it a-z ?
 *      subls  r3, r2, #0x20        ; then subtract 32
 *      strbls r3, [r4, r2]
 *      add    r4, r4, #1
 *      cmp    r4, #0x40            ; 64 bytes
 *
 * The classic branch-free `islower` -- subtract `'a'`, treat as unsigned, one
 * compare covers both ends of the range -- applied **in place** across a
 * **64-byte** name field.
 *
 * So track names are normalised to uppercase **once, at load time**, and every
 * later lookup is a plain case-sensitive compare against an uppercase name.
 * That is why the `.events` files can carry mixed-case artist names like
 * `smokeparticle fbx` and `Smoke_FLOAT fbx` while the code never calls a
 * case-insensitive compare anywhere.
 *
 * **A port must uppercase too.** Skip it and every lookup fails for any track
 * whose author used lowercase -- which, from the shipped data, is most of them.
 *
 * ## A second array at +0xd4
 *
 *      ldr  r6, [r6, #0x9c]        ; a per-track count
 *      lsl  r2, r6, #6             ; count * 64
 *      lsl  r1, r6, #2             ; count * 4
 *      add  r1, r1, r2             ; -> count * 68
 *      bl   limeMalloc
 *      str  r0, [r8, #0xd4]
 *
 * A **68-byte** record array, sized from a count at `+0x9c` and hung off
 * `+0xd4` -- immediately after `+0xd0`, the instance cap established by
 * LIME_TriggerEventFromSceneH and LIME_PlayFBXAtPos.
 *
 * ## Failure behaviour
 *
 * A missing file returns NULL. A zero track count frees the buffer and returns
 * NULL as well, so an empty `.events` file and an absent one are
 * indistinguishable to the caller -- which matters, because LIME_LoadScene
 * stores this result without checking it.
 *
 * ## 44 bytes on disk become 216 in memory
 *
 * The parse is a field-by-field copy with a **remap**, not a memcpy. The disk
 * record advances by `0x2c` -- 44 bytes, eleven words -- and its fields land
 * scattered across the 216-byte runtime record:
 *
 * ```
 *   disk        memory
 *   +0x00   ->  +0x08
 *   +0x00   ->  +0x0c        (read again through a second pointer)
 *   +0x04   ->  +0x10
 *   +0x08   ->  +0x14
 *   +0x0c   ->  +0x18
 *   +0x10   ->  +0x1c
 *   +0x14   ->  +0x20
 *   +0x18   ->  +0x6c
 *   +0x1c   ->  +0xc8
 *   +0x20   ->  +0xcc
 *   +0x24   ->  +0x68
 *   +0x28   ->  +0x24
 * ```
 *
 * Eleven source words, twelve destinations, and the destinations are nowhere
 * near contiguous -- `+0x18` on disk jumps to `+0x6c`, and the next two go to
 * `+0xc8` and `+0xcc`, past the middle of the record. **Any external tool that
 * reads a `.events` file needs this table**; treating the file as the runtime
 * struct produces a record that looks plausible and is wrong in every field
 * after the seventh.
 *
 * The gaps are where the runtime fields live that the file does not carry --
 * `+0xd0` is the instance cap, `+0xd4` the array allocated from `+0x9c`, and
 * the block from `+0x28` up is written by LIME_PlayFBXAtPos when it builds a
 * track by hand.
 *
 * The names are copied ahead of this and uppercased in place, as described

 *
 * armv6 0x000e88ac, 556 bytes.  **Structurally complete.**
 *
 * Draws every live event once per frame.
 *
 * ## Two translations, and what they identify
 *
 * The interesting part is a pair of `glTranslatef` calls back to back:
 *
 *      ldr  r3, [r4, #0x10]        ; the event's scene
 *      ldr  r0, [r3, #0x54]
 *      ldr  r1, [r3, #0x58]
 *      ldr  r2, [r3, #0x5c]
 *      bl   _glTranslatef          ; ...to the scene's origin
 *
 *      ldr  r0, [r4, #0x50]
 *      ldr  r1, [r4, #0x54]
 *      ldr  r2, [r4, #0x58]
 *      bl   _glTranslatef          ; ...then by the event's own offset
 *
 * Two independent facts fall out.
 *
 * **`EVENT+0x10` is the scene pointer**, which is exactly where
 * LIME_UpdateEvents reads it from (`ldr ip, [r4, #0x10]`, then `[ip, #0x44]`
 * for count2). Two functions, one offset, same meaning.
 *
 * **`SCENEINFO+0x54`, `+0x58` and `+0x5c` are a position**, three consecutive
 * words fed straight to glTranslatef. LIME_LoadScene fills those three from a
 * sibling file and this is what they turn out to be for -- the loader showed
 * where they come from, this shows what they mean, and neither alone would
 * have been enough to name them.
 *
 * An effect is therefore placed **relative to its scene**: the scene's origin
 * first, the event's own offset second. A port that positions effects in world
 * space will have every one of them land in the right place only while the
 * scene sits at the origin.
 *
 * ## The rest
 *
 * Fields `+0x38`, `+0x40`, `+0x48` and `+0x4c` gate the draw -- `+0x4c` is
 * compared against 1 specifically, so it is a mode rather than a flag. `+0x64`
 * reaches a float at `[r1, #0x3c]`. `limeMatrixMult` composes the transform and
 * `RenderDebugCube` is called from here, which is the only caller recovered so
 * far for that half-stripped function.
 *
 * ## Four gates before anything is drawn
 *
 * ```
 *   +0x48  compared against a register held across the whole walk
 *   +0x38  the start delay -- non-zero means not yet
 *   +0x4c  compared against 1 specifically, so a mode rather than a flag
 *   +0x64  a float compare
 * ```
 *
 * ## And the scene is drawn TWICE
 *
 *      bl LIME_RenderScene          ; scene at +0x10, args from +0xe8, +0xec
 *      ...
 *      bl LIME_RenderScene          ; again, different arguments
 *
 * Two calls, each handed `ev->scene` with a different pair of fields from
 * `+0xe8` and `+0xec`. Whether that is two passes over one scene or two scenes
 * sharing a slot is not settled -- both calls read the same `+0x10` -- so the
 * body below performs both and names neither.
 *
 * ## The translate pair is symmetric around the pop
 *
 * `glTranslatef(scene position)` then `glTranslatef(event offset)` appears
 * **before** the draw and again **after** `LIME_PopMatrix`, with a `glCullFace`
 * gated on `+0x44` each time. So the function does not rely on the matrix stack
 * alone to undo its placement; it re-applies the same transform on the way out.
 *
 * A port that assumes push/pop is sufficient and drops the second pair will find
 * the *next* event drawn at the wrong place, not this one -- which is the kind
 * of off-by-one-object error that looks like bad data.
 */
/* **It takes an argument, and it is a filter.** This was written with none.
 * The binary keeps it in `fp` across the whole loop and tests every event
 * against it:
 *
 *      ldr r3, [r4]        ; ev->state
 *      cmp r3, #0
 *      beq next            ; skip when zero
 *      blt next            ; and when negative -- so the test is state > 0
 *      ldr r3, [r4, #0x48]
 *      cmp r3, fp          ; the argument
 *      bne next            ; only this group is drawn
 *
 * So a caller renders one group of events at a time rather than the whole
 * pool, and `+0x48` is which group an event belongs to. `tools/protos.py`
 * found the missing parameter; the filter came from reading what it is for.

 *
 * One multiply as two shifts and an add, the same trick LIME_LoadBones and

 * parsed field by field, so **the on-disk and in-memory layouts are identical
 * for these 80 bytes** -- unlike `.bones`, where 25 bytes on disk become 56 in
 * memory.
 *
 * Within a record the code reads a float at `+0x40`, an int at `+0x44` and a

 *
 * That is worth seeing rather than skipping past: this loader was clearly
 * awkward enough to need tracing while it was being written, and every one of
 * those messages is gone. Reading the retail binary means reading code whose
 * author had more information than we do.
 *
 * The file buffer is freed on both the success and the failure path.
 *
 * The per-record field reads are left out of the body: the code touches a float
 * at +0x40, an int at +0x44 and a float at +0x48 of each record, but what it
 * does with them was not traced, and the table is already usable without it --

 *
 * Fires a scene's event tracks, offset, and only for tracks that are
 * "following" -- the name is doing real work here.
 *
 * ## What it walks
 *
 * The scene's events come from `scene->[0x84]`, and within a track it reads
 * `+0xd4` -- the 68-byte record array `LIME_LoadEvents` allocates from the
 * count at `+0x9c`. So this is the only recovered consumer of that array, and
 * it confirms the loader was allocating something real rather than reserving
 * space.
 *
 * A track is tested with `[r5, #0x24]` against **1** specifically, so `+0x24`
 * is a mode with at least one distinguished value rather than a boolean.
 *
 * ## The DS matrix appears again
 *
 *      bl _ConvertDSMatrixtoPCMatrix
 *
 * The offset is stored in the **Nintendo DS 1.3.12 fixed-point format** and
 * converted here at runtime -- see LIMEDS_Misc.c, where that function's `1/4096`
 * scale is what identified the format. This is the second place the engine pays
 * for its handheld ancestry at frame rate rather than at build time.
 *
 * It produces a row-major matrix that needs transposing for GL, unlike the
 * basis-built matrices elsewhere. A port that feeds this result straight to
 * `glMultMatrixf` gets a transposed offset, which places every following effect
 * in the wrong spot in a way that looks like a bad export rather than a bug.
 *
 * ## Diagnostics that DID survive
 *
 * Unusually, it calls `printf` and `puts` -- the real ones, not `LIME_printf`.
 * Everything else in lime/common logs through the compiled-away wrapper, so
 * these two lines still reach stdout in the retail build. Worth knowing before
 * someone wonders where stray console output comes from.
 *
 * ## Two spawn sites, one per branch of the mode test
 *
 * `LIME_TriggerEvent` is called twice, on the two sides of `track->[0x24] == 1`.
 * The body below performs both and marks which is which by the test rather than
 * by a name for the mode, because one compare against one value is not enough to
 * say what the mode means.

 * (104) = 136 = 0x88, so `[sp, #0x88]` is the caller's first stacked argument
 * -- and the body reads that and every word up to `[sp, #0xa0]`, which is
 * seven more. GameCode.c had always declared eleven, with names.
 *
 * The body below still only models the first four. The rest are named so the
 * interface is right and marked unused so it is obvious which half is read.

/* armv7 0x000a4ea0. The same walk for a fighter's scene, with the frame
 * matched exactly (no modulus). A track whose +0x24 is 1 follows the
 * fighter -- its events are placed against `mFollow` -- and every other
 * track against `m`. Returns how many events it fired.
 *
 * `printed` starts the "printed the header line" flag: the caller passes 0
 * on the first call of a frame and 1 after. Frame 0x116 also prints
 * "got ya" (`puts`, 0xa4fa6). */
