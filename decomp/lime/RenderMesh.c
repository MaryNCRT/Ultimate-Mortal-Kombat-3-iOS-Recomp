 * RenderMesh.c — src/lime/common/RenderMesh.cpp (mesh loading)
 *
 * Hand-written from the disassembly of the armv7 slice (0x0005e2b8,
 * 0x0005e7f4, 0x0005ea34) and verified against the oracle: the original
 * LIME_LoadMeshSet, statically recompiled, was run over the game's real data
 * and this implementation reproduces it — see tests/test_rendermesh_diff.c.
 *
 * The format itself is documented in docs/MESHSET-FORMAT.md, and that
 * specification was itself checked by running EA's loader over 590 files.
 *
 * Difference from the original, deliberately: the original allocates through
 * limeMalloc and reads through limeLoadFile, both of which are iOS platform
 * layer. Here allocation is plain malloc and file access goes through
 * limeLoadFile(), which the platform layer provides. Behaviour is identical;
 * only the plumbing changed.

 *  - a line is skipped if its first byte is `0x23` (a hash) **or zero**, so
 *    blank lines are comments too;
 *  - each accepted line is copied into a table with a **stride of 0x40** and
 *    the name at **+4**, the count living at the table base. The copy is four
 *    unrolled `ldm`/`stm` pairs -- 64 bytes, fixed -- so a name has 60 bytes of
 *    room. The longest shipped entry is 26 characters.
 *  - lookup is a linear `strstr` down the table -- a **substring** test, not an
 *    equality test. Forty entries per texture, not worth indexing at this size.
 *
 * `_FullBrightLoaded` (`__DATA,__data`) and `_TheFullBrightInfo`
 * (`__DATA,__common`) are both in the symbol table under those names, so the
 * caching and the table are the original design and not an inference.
 *
 * **`_IsTextureFullBrightPath` is not a third global.** An earlier pass here
 * listed it as one and described the file path as configurable. It is not: the
 * symbol lives in `__TEXT,__text`, so it is a **function** -- the wrapper below
 * that strips a directory prefix and calls this. The path itself is a literal.
 * Checking the section a symbol lives in takes one grep and would have caught
 * that before it was written down.
 *
 * ## The `.???` convention, settled
 *
 * An earlier pass through this function called the comparison a `strcmp` and
 * left the wildcard as an open question. Resolving the import stubs corrected
 * both halves.
 *
 * The call is **`strstr`**, and `GetNextLine` stores each line verbatim -- it
 * copies until NUL, CR or LF and terminates, so the `.???` really is in the
 * table. For `strstr(name, entry)` to ever match, **the texture names the
 * engine passes in must contain `.???` literally**.
 *
 * They do. **591 of the 605 shipped `.meshset` files contain the string
 * `.???`**: texture names are stored inside the geometry with that extension
 * already in place, which is why the header of `nolight.txt` tells artists to
 * write them the same way. Nothing normalises anything at runtime -- the
 * convention is baked into the data on both sides.
 *
 * That it is `strstr` rather than an equality test has a consequence for
 * modders worth stating: **an entry matches any texture name containing it**.
 * Putting `ICE` in `nolight.txt` would unlight every texture with `ICE`
 * anywhere in its name. The shipped file always writes complete names, so the
 * behaviour never shows, but it is the difference between a list of names and
 * a list of patterns.

 *
 * That makes three functions in this engine whose bodies are gone but whose

 *
 * armv6 0x0008186c, 468 bytes.  **Structurally complete.**
 *
 * Resolves the textures a meshset names into loaded TEXTURE pointers.
 *
 * ## The meshset's texture table
 *
 *      ldr  r2, [r6, #0x44]        ; count
 *      ldr  r3, [r6, #0x48]        ; array base
 *      ldr  r5, [r3, r8, lsl #2]   ; pointers, 4 bytes apart
 *
 * So `MESHSETINFO+0x44` is a count and `+0x48` an array of pointers, walked
 * with a null check per entry -- **holes in the table are legal**, not an
 * error. Each entry gets a zero written at its own `+0x48` before anything
 * else, which is the per-texture slot being cleared before it is filled.
 *
 * `MESHSETINFO+0x40` short-circuits the whole function when non-zero: textures
 * are resolved **once per meshset**, not once per use. That pairs with the
 * scene cache in LIME_LoadScene -- the engine is careful about this in two
 * separate places, so a port that re-resolves per draw is fighting the design.
 *
 * ## The second argument builds THREE name variants
 *
 * When the suffix argument is non-null, three names are composed into three
 * 0x80-byte stack buffers before the table is walked:
 *
 *      add  r0, sp, #0x180  ; buffer 1
 *      mov  r2, sl          ; the suffix
 *      bl   <3-arg string build>
 *      add  r0, sp, #0x100  ; buffer 2
 *      ...
 *      add  r0, sp, #0x80   ; buffer 3
 *
 * Three different format strings, one suffix, three candidate filenames. That
 * is a **texture variant mechanism**: the same meshset drawn with a different
 * suffix resolves to a different set of texture files.
 *
 * What the three formats are is not read out here -- they are PC-relative
 * literals in a pool this pass could not resolve cleanly, and the project has
 * a standing rule against stating constants it could not pin down. The
 * *shape* is solid: three candidates, tried per texture, selected by a
 * caller-supplied suffix.
 *
 * This is worth following up. Alternate costumes, the frozen and the burning
 * variants of a fighter, and the palette-swapped ninjas are all the same
 * geometry with different textures, and this is the only mechanism recovered
 * so far that could express that. See docs/HIDDEN-CONTENT.md for what is
 * already known to ship unused.
 *
 * The three format strings are not written out. They are PC-relative literals
 * in a pool this pass could not resolve, and the project does not state
 * constants it could not pin down -- so the body composes the candidates
 * through a helper whose contents are left for whoever resolves them.

/* ------------------------------------------------------- LIME_RenderMeshSingle
 *
 * armv6 0x00080da4, 680 bytes.  **Structurally complete.**
 *
 * Draws one mesh with up to two textures. The last function in this file to be
 * read, and the one that finally names a TEXTURE field.
 *
 * ## TEXTURE+0x40 is the GL handle
 *
 *      ldr r1, [r5, #0x40]
 *      bl  _glBindTexture
 *
 * The value at `+0x40` of a TEXTURE goes straight into `glBindTexture` as the
 * name. `LIME_RenderMeshSingleIndexed` does the same at the same offset, so two
 * functions agree -- which is the standard a field identification has to meet
 * here, and the first thing recovered about the inside of a TEXTURE. Everything
 * else about that struct is still opaque, and `lime.h` keeps it that way.
 *
 * Both textures are also tested at `+0x50` before the draw, and the two tests
 * gate different branches. `+0x50` is where MESHINFO caches its
 * `IsTextureFullBright` answer, so the same offset holding a lighting flag on a
 * texture is plausible -- and plausible is not established, so it is recorded
 * by offset and not named.
 *
 * ## The mesh's scale is pushed and popped around the draw
 *
 *      vldr s15, [r4, #0x10]
 *      bl   _glPushMatrix
 *      bl   _glScalef
 *      bl   _glDrawElements
 *      bl   _glPopMatrix
 *
 * So a mesh carries its own scale at `+0x10` and it is applied for exactly the
 * duration of its draw. Nothing downstream inherits it, and nothing upstream
 * has to know about it.
 *
 * Note this calls **`glPushMatrix` directly, not `LIME_PushMatrix`**. The
 * wrapper exists precisely so the platform layer has one place to intercept,
 * and this function bypasses it. A port that hooks only the LIME_ wrappers will
 * miss this push and pop, and the mismatch shows up as a matrix stack that
 * drifts by one somewhere else entirely.
 *
 * `glDepthMask` is likewise called directly rather than through
 * `limeEnableDepthWrites`. Two engines' worth of abstraction and the hot path
 * goes round both.
 *
 * ## Texture units
 *
 * `glClientActiveTexture` and `glActiveTexture` appear in pairs, before the
 * draw and again after, with the client array state enabled and disabled around
 * them. The teardown is what leaves the units in a known state for the next
 * draw -- the same discipline FlushTranspMeshList relies on.
 *
 * ## The `+0x50` tests select the lit path
 *
 * `MESHINFO+0x50` is `fullBright` -- the cached `IsTextureFullBright` answer --
 * and the texture is tested at the same offset. When either says full-bright the
 * function branches **past the colour work entirely**:
 *
 *      ldr r3, [r5, #0x50]      ; the texture's flag
 *      ...
 *      ldr r3, [r4, #0x50]      ; the mesh's fullBright
 *      cmp r3, #0
 *      bne #0x80f9c             ; -> skip the lighting
 *
 * The lit path reads `mesh->vertLight` at `+0x24`, runs it through
 * `CreateFadedRGBS`, and hands the **result** to `glColorPointer`. So a
 * full-bright surface does not merely ignore its vertex colours -- it never
 * computes them, which is the saving the whole `res/nolight.txt` mechanism
 * exists for.
 *
 * That call is also what settles CreateFadedRGBS's argument order: the mesh's
 * light bytes go in first and the buffer drawn from comes out second.
 *
 * ## Teardown is two units, and it is not symmetric with setup
 *
 * Setup touches one texture unit. Teardown walks **two**, each with its own
 * `glClientActiveTexture` / `glActiveTexture` / `glColor4f`, then six
 * `glDisable` and `glDisableClientState` calls.
 *
 * The asymmetry is deliberate: the function leaves both units clean regardless
 * of how many it used, so the next draw starts from a known state whichever path
 * this one took. A port that mirrors setup in teardown leaves unit 1 configured
 * after a single-texture mesh, and the next multi-texture draw inherits it.
 *
 * **Why the GL enums are not all named, corrected.** An earlier note here said
 * they resolve to addresses rather than values. That is wrong for most of
 * them -- `tools/annotate.py` reads the literal pools and they come out as
 * clean GL constants.
 *
 * The real obstacle is **pairing**. The compiler interleaves the loads with
 * the calls: in this function a `GL_VERTEX_ARRAY` is loaded immediately
 * before a `glClientActiveTexture`, which does not take that enum -- the
 * value belongs to a later call and the register was simply free. So the
 * constants present are known and which call consumes each one is not, and
 * the body names an enum only where the call admits exactly one.
 */
