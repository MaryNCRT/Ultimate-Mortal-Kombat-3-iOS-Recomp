/* `_TrainingData` -- 0x001782e8. The indexing in `TrainingMessages` gives the
 * whole shape away without any of it being written down anywhere:
 *
 *      byte offset = character * 288 + category * 96 + move * 24
 *
 * so an entry is **24 bytes**, there are **4 moves** per category (4 * 24 = 96),
 * **3 categories** per character (3 * 96 = 288), and the array is indexed by
 * `Character1` first.
 *
 * The same function then reads a second string at `base - 12 + Settings[4] * 4`
 * where `Settings[4]` is the button layout, 4, 5 or 6. That resolves to
 * `base + 4`, `base + 8` and `base + 12` -- so the first four words of an entry
 * are the move's name and its notation written three ways, one per layout, and
 * the remaining two words are not read here.
 *
 * A NULL name is the end marker: the move counter wraps to 0 when it lands on
 * one, which is how a character with fewer than four moves in a category still
 * cycles correctly. */

/* ---------------------------------------------------------- TrainingMessages
 *
 * armv7 0x000a7930, 884 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Called once a frame while training is running. It is a three-way choice, and
 * the two message states take priority over the prompt:
 *
 *      TrainingGoodMessage > 0   draw "WELL DONE", count it down
 *      TrainingBadMessage  > 0   draw "TRY AGAIN", count it down
 *      otherwise                 draw the current move's name and notation
 *
 * Both counters tick by **-1.0 / limeFPSScaleFactor** in double precision and
 * are stored back as floats, so the messages last a fixed wall-clock time
 * rather than a fixed number of frames.
 *
 * ### The two messages are drawn with raw coordinates
 *
 *      limeDrawFONT(GameFont, text, limeScreenWidth / 2, 66.0f, 1, 1.0f, fontcol)
 *
 * `66.0f` and a scale of `1.0f`, with no `FE_Y` and no `FE_WidthScale`. This
 * is in-game text, not front-end text, and it does not participate in the
 * front end's scaling at all -- so on a screen where those differ the training
 * prompt sits somewhere the menus never would.
 *
 * The strings are **compiled-in English literals**, not `GameText` ids:
 * `"WELL DONE"`, `"TRY AGAIN"` and the `"%s : %s"` that joins the move name to
 * its notation. Training mode is not translated.
 *
 * ### What happens when a message finishes
 *
 * Both endings call
 *
 *      mk3_init(PLAYER1MODEL, PLAYER2MODEL, FrameID_GetBBox, flag)
 *      if (TrainingCatagory == 2) mk3_dizzy();
 *      LIME_KillAllEvents();
 *      BabalityMessage = FriendshipMessage = AnimalityMessage = FatalityMessage = 0;
 *
 * -- the fight is rebuilt from scratch between every training attempt, and
 * **category 2 additionally dizzies the opponent**, which is what makes the
 * finishing-move category practisable at all.
 *
 * Clearing the four finisher banners is why a failed babality attempt does not
 * leave its message on screen into the next attempt.
 *
 * ### Advancing the move, and the end marker
 *
 *      TrainingMoveCount = (TrainingMoveCount + 1) % 4;
 *      if (TrainingData[...].name == NULL) TrainingMoveCount = 0;
 *
 * The modulo is signed and written out with the usual sign correction. The
 * NULL check is the only thing that keeps a short category from showing blank
 * prompts, and it only ever wraps to 0 -- it does not search, so a category
 * with a hole in the middle would stop at the hole.
 *
 * **The success path passes the move's name pointer to `mk3_init` as its
 * fourth argument** where the failure path passes a literal 0. Whatever that
 * argument means to the fight logic, "the move you just did" and "nothing" are
 * the two values it gets from here.
