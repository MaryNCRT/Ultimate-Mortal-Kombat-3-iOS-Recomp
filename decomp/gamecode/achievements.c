 *
 * achievementsIncreaseSubzeroXerox reaches `[r2, #0x5c]` -- index 23 -- and the
 * compiler caught the contradiction at -Wextra as soon as it was written. The
 * real bound is in the symbol table: `_achievementTracker` sits at 0x00379c60
 * and the next symbol, `_SceneEvents`, at 0x00379cc0, so the block is 96 bytes,
 * 24 words, and index 23 is its last slot exactly.
 *
 * Nothing here says what an entry means, only that 1 is the value being counted

 *
 * ### The banner slides on a sine and eases at the wrong end
 *
 *      y = limeScreenHeight + sin(timer) * -32 * FE_HeightScale
 *
 * At `timer == 0` that is exactly the bottom of the screen -- off it. At PI/2
 * the banner is 32 scaled units up, fully visible. At PI it is back off the
 * bottom. One half-period of sine is the whole animation.
 *
 * The timer advances by
 *
 *      timer += fabs(cos(timer) * 0.05) + 0.01
 *
 * and `|cos|` is **largest at the ends and smallest in the middle**, so the
 * banner moves fast on the way in, **lingers at the top**, and moves fast on
 * the way out. That is the opposite of the ease-in-out a port would reach for
 * by default, and it is exactly what a notification wants. The `+ 0.01` floor
 * is what stops it stalling completely at PI/2, where `cos` is zero.
 *
 * Both the sine and the step are computed in **double**; only the final Y is
 * narrowed.
 *
 * **The timer does not advance while `GamePaused` is set** -- the banner
 * freezes mid-slide rather than running out behind the pause menu.
 *
 * ### The three tracker states, from the reading side
 *
 * `achievementsUnlock` writes 1, 2 or 4. Here is what they mean:
 *
 *      1   sliding -- draw the banner and advance the timer
 *      2   done -- counted, never drawn again
 *      4   unlocked while the achievements screen was open; on the first frame
 *          the screen is NOT open it becomes 1 and starts sliding
 *
 * So 4 is a deferred 1, and this function is what defers it. Reaching PI sets
 * the entry to 2 and zeroes its timer.
 *
 * ### Achievement 17 is awarded for the other nineteen
 *
 *      if (finished == 19 && achievementTracker[17] == 0)
 *          achievementsUnlock(17);
 *
 * `finished` counts entries in state 2 across the twenty slots this loop walks.
 * So slot 17 is the meta-achievement, and it is granted from inside the draw
 * loop rather than from wherever the other nineteen are earned.
 *
 * Two lines of text per banner: `GameText(0x65)` -- a fixed heading -- in grey
 * at 0.9 scale, and `GameText(descr[i].id)` in white at 0.65, both offset from
 * the sliding Y.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- drawKodeTip
 *
 * armv7 0x000a0530, 804 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Shows one kode's button sequence: two lines of text and **six glyphs**, drawn
 * from `KOMBAT_KODES_TPAGE.PNG`.
 *
 * The six values come straight out of `_kodes[index]` -- words 0 through 5 of
 * its 32-byte entry, copied into two stack arrays of three. **Those are exactly
 * the six words `checkIfKode` compares against `KodeSelector[0..2]` and
 * `[7..9]`**, so this function is the display side of the same six-symbol
 * sequence: three per row, two rows.
 *
 * ### The glyph atlas is 5 wide with 48-pixel cells
 *
 *      column = value % 5
 *      row    = value / 5
 *      u0 = column * 48 * (1/256)      u1 = 0.1875   (48/256)
 *      v0 = row    * 48 * (1/128)      v1 = 0.375    (48/128)
 *
 * -- a 256x128 texture in a 5x2 grid of 48x48 cells with padding. The `% 5` is
 * a reciprocal multiply with magic `0x66666667` and a shift of 1, worked out
 * numerically rather than assumed, and the `* 48` is spelled `(n << 6) -
 * (n << 4)` both times.
 *
 * So a kode symbol is a **number 0..9** and the atlas holds ten glyphs. That is
 * the alphabet of the kode screen.
 *
 * The glyphs step 32 apart horizontally, and the second row is offset by
 * `+0x74` -- 116 -- from the first.
 *
 * ### It reloads the texture every single call
 *
 *      *KodesTexture = limeLoadTexture("KOMBAT_KODES_TPAGE.PNG", 0, 0);
 *
 * unconditionally, at the top of every frame this tip is on screen, and the
 * previous handle is overwritten without being freed. `drawLoadingBackground`
 * does a defensive reload too, but only when its handle is NULL; this one does
 * not check. Whether `limeLoadTexture` caches by name is not established here,
 * and if it does not this leaks a texture per frame.
 *
 * That is worth flagging rather than reproducing: a port should load it once.
 *
 * The two labels are `GameText(0x363)` and `GameText(0x364)`, at 240 and 132
 * scaled, with the usual `FE_WidthScale` / `FE_HeightScale` pair.
