 *      out->y = PlayerZPos                          <- copied as a raw word
 *      out->z = -(float)obj->y / WorldScaleAdjust
 *               + PlayerDefs[remap].height
 *
 * **The arcade Y is negated and lands in Z.** The arcade runs Y down the
 * screen; the engine runs Z up the world. That sign is the whole conversion and
 * it is the easiest thing here to lose.
 *
 * `PlayerZPos` is moved with `ldr`/`str`, not through the FPU -- the bit
 * pattern is copied, so a signalling NaN would survive it intact. Transcribed
 * as a word copy for that reason.
 *
 * The player-def index comes from `FrameRemapTable[obj->frame]`, and the frame
 * id is read SIGNED (`ldrsh`), so a negative frame indexes backwards off the
 * front of the table. Nothing guards it.
 *
 * ### The branch that does not branch
 *
 * `obj->flags & 0x10` selects between two literal-pool entries -- and **both
 * resolve to `_WorldScaleAdjust` at 0x0014df9c**, checked by hand rather than
 * trusted from the tool. The neighbours are `_blast_player_height` at
 * 0x0014df98 and `_psp_scale` at 0x0014dfa0, so there is no second symbol
 * hiding at that address.
 *
 * So the test is vestigial: whichever way it goes, the divisor is the same.
 * It is transcribed as the single divisor it really is, with the flag noted
 * here, because writing an `if` whose arms are identical would be inventing a
 * distinction the machine does not make.
 *
 * **Why it is there is now known.** `ArcadePosTo3dPos` below is the same
 * function with the player offsets kept, and there the very same
 * `flags & 0x10` chooses the SIGN of the X offset -- subtract when set, add
 * when clear. Drop the offset term and the test has nothing left to select.
 * The dead branch here is the scar of that function, not a compiler artefact.

 *
 * Matches the current joystick state against a 76-entry move table and returns
 * the arcade bit pattern for whatever it found.
 *
 * ### Facing-relative directions are converted on the way OUT, not in
 *
 * The table stores `JOY_TOWARD` / `JOY_AWAY`; the game wants `JOY_LEFT` /
 * `JOY_RIGHT`. The tail does the swap and it is a genuine mirror:
 *
 *      facing != 0:   AWAY -> RIGHT,  TOWARD -> LEFT
 *      facing == 0:   AWAY -> LEFT,   TOWARD -> RIGHT
 *
 * then clears both relative bits. **Both arms then re-test `0x800` on the
 * value they are building, not on the original** -- so a pattern holding both
 * TOWARD and AWAY comes out with both LEFT and RIGHT set rather than one.
 * Transcribed as written; it is reachable only from a table entry that sets
 * both, and whether any does is not established here.
 *
 * ### The 0x80 button is edge-detected against the previous frame
 *
 * `_LastJoyBitsIn` is read and immediately overwritten with this frame's bits,
 * and the match then uses `~previous & current & 0x80` -- the rising edge, not
 * the level. Only entries whose mask has a relative direction bit take that
 * path; the rest compare the raw bits with `0x1800` masked off.
 *
 * That edge is why `_LastJoyBitsIn` must be updated **once per call and before
 * anything else**: a port that refreshes it after the scan, or twice, changes
 * which frame a button counts on.
 *
 * ### An assertion that hangs
 *
 * On a match it looks the move up in `_VeteranMoves` and checks the entry
 * agrees with its own index:
 *
 *      if (VeteranMoves[idx].index != idx) for (;;) ;
 *
 * A branch to its own address, the same shape `Error()` uses. It shipped in
 * retail, so it is a table-consistency assertion nobody expected to fire. A
 * port should make it loud rather than silent -- but it must not be dropped,
 * because reaching it means the move tables are wrong.
 *
 * `0xcf` in a mask is a sentinel: it ends the scan with a tail call to
 * `RemapKicksPunches` on the accumulated bits instead of a table lookup.
 * Falling off the end of the 76 entries returns 0.

 *
 * armv7 0x0001c464, 304 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * The full version of the conversion `ArcadePosTo3dPosNO_OFFSETS` does without
 * the player offsets. Same core arithmetic:
 *
 *      out->x = obj->x / WorldScaleAdjust  -/+ def->xOffset
 *      out->y = PlayerZPos
 *      out->z = -obj->y / WorldScaleAdjust  +  def->height
 *
 * ### The flag bit that was vestigial there is load-bearing here
 *
 * `obj->flags & 0x10` chooses the SIGN of the X offset -- subtract when set,
 * add when clear -- and nothing else differs between the two arms. In
 * `NO_OFFSETS` the same test survives with both arms resolving to the same
 * literal-pool entry, which read as a branch that does not branch.
 *
 * Together they explain each other: the two functions share a shape, the
 * offset term was dropped from the NO_OFFSETS variant, and the test that
 * selected its sign was left behind with nothing to select. So the dead branch
 * there is not a compiler artefact -- it is the scar of this function.
 *
 * ### Three ways to reach a PLAYERDEF, and a sentinel
 *
 *      frame == 20000        no def at all: raw divide, no offsets, no height
 *      third argument NULL   def = PlayerDefs[FrameRemapTable[frame]]
 *      otherwise             def = PlayerDefs[*(signed char *)arg]
 *
 * The third argument is a pointer to a single SIGNED byte holding a character
 * index -- not the index itself. A negative byte indexes backwards off the
 * front of the table, and nothing guards it.
 *
 * **A frame above 7243 returns without writing anything**, leaving the caller
 * vector holding whatever it did before. Note 7243, one below the 7244 that
 * bounds `LoadAllFramesTXT` and one below the `> 7244` that `FrameID_GetBBox`
 * rejects on -- three related limits, three different numbers. They are
 * recorded as they are rather than reconciled.
 *
 * `PlayerZPos` is copied as a word here too, never through the FPU.

 *
 *      player 1:  IntroCount  -> IntroLists[Character1] -> IntroFrame1
 *      player 2:  IntroCount2 -> IntroLists[Character2] -> IntroFrame2
 *
 * Each half is skipped entirely if that player has no loaded character
 * (`+0x04` of the PLAYER, and `+0x5f4` for the second -- 0x5f0 plus the same
 * four, confirming the player stride from a third function).
 *
 * ### The frame is only overwritten when the list agrees
 *

 * reading past the array -- and the sticky global is what makes that work.
 * Clamping the index instead would look equivalent and is not: it would replay
 * the last entry rather than hold whatever was last accepted.
 *
 * The counters are floats converted with `vcvt.s32.f32`, so they advance

 *

 * rounding transcribed as emitted, the same shape `AnimateFECharacters` uses.
 *
 * ### The smoothing window is borrowed again, at a different value
 *
 * `_AnimSmoothWindowSize` is saved, set to **0x14** and restored -- twenty,
 * where `AnimateFECharacters` uses forty for the same global. So intros smooth
 * over half the window the menus do, and both leave the game's own value
 * untouched.

 *
 * Steps one intro frame for each fighter, then calls
 * `UpdateIntroCharacterPlayers` to push the result into the players.
 *
 * ### Which fighter advances is decided by IntroCamCount
 *
 *      IntroCamCount == 0   ->  player 2 always;  player 1 only if `force`
 *      IntroCamCount != 0   ->  player 1 always;  player 2 only if `force`
 *
 * The two tests are built from the same `force != 0` boolean with an `orr #1`
 * on opposite arms, so exactly one fighter is unconditional at any moment and
 * the argument overrides that. The intro alternates whose animation runs by
 * flipping one counter.
 *
 * ### The counter is clamped UP, not down: only the last 120 entries play
 *
 * Per fighter:
 *
 *      count += 1.0f
 *      n = SizeofIntroLists[character]
 *      if (n == 0) { IntroCountTimer = 1.0f; }
 *      else {
 *          limit = n / 4 - 120
 *          if (count < limit) { count = limit; if (limit < 0) count = 0; }
 *          if (!force) IntroCountTimer += 1/120
 *      }
 *
 * `count < limit` sets `count = limit` -- forward, not back. So an intro whose
 * list is longer than 120 entries **never plays anything before its last 120**;
 * the counter is snapped past them on the first frame and increments normally
 * after that. A list shorter than 120 gives a negative limit and the counter is
 * reset to 0 instead.
 *
 * A clamp written the other way round -- the obvious reading -- makes long
 * intros play from the beginning and run 120 frames too long. This is the
 * detail in the function.
 *
 * ### The timer step is 1/120
 *
 * `0.008333333767950535`, the nearest float to 1/120, and only when `force` is
 * zero. So the timer tracks unforced frames only, and at 30 fps it reaches 1.0
 * after four seconds of them.
 *
 * The `n == 0` path sets the timer to a flat 1.0 and skips the counter work
 * entirely -- a character with no intro list is treated as already finished.

 * until a slot has already passed both tests.
 *
 * ### The outer radius stops scaling under P2 controls

 * not 96 the two players get different dial sizes. Transcribed as written --
 * it reads like a hardcoded pixel value someone dropped in, and reproducing it
 * is the only way a port behaves the same.
 *
 * It also writes the global every call rather than computing a local, so
 * anything else reading `JOUTERDIAL` sees whichever player was checked last.

 *      if (t < 0) t += 1
 *      dir = (((int)((1 - t) * 256) + 16) & 0xFF) >> 5
 *
 * The `acos` is done in **double** precision -- `vcvt.f64.f32` in, the divide
 * by PI in `.f64`, and only then narrowed back. PI is the literal
 * 3.1415927410125732, the float value widened, not the double constant.
 *
 * The last line is the whole quantiser: scale to 256, add half a sector (16),
 * wrap to a byte, and take the top three bits. The `& 0xFF` is what makes the
 * wrap free, so sector 7 and sector 0 meet without a special case.
 *
 * `dy` is computed as `centre - touch` and `dx` as `touch - centre` -- opposite
 * senses, which is what puts screen-down and angle-up the same way round.

 *
 * ### The four unlock flags are named here
 *
 *      ClassicSubZeroUnlocked, ErmacUnlocked, MileenaUnlocked, JadeUnlocked
 *
 * -- the four classic MK3 hidden fighters, each its own word in the save at
 * +0x10 through +0x1c. So the hidden roster is not a derived state or a kode
 * side effect: it is **persisted, one flag per character**, and whatever sets
 * them is what a port has to find. Nothing in this function writes them; it
 * only copies them out.
 *
 * ### It does nothing at all unless GameMode is 0
 *
 * The whole body is skipped for any other mode, and the function then falls
 * straight to the survival check. So a save written during an arcade ladder is
 * written by somebody else, or not at all.
 *
 * ### The checksum is a plain sum
 *
 * Every word stored is added into a running total and the total goes in the
 * last word, +0xa8. Not a CRC, not weighted -- an unsigned sum, so any two
 * fields that swap values leave it unchanged. The size passed to
 * `limeWriteFile` is 0xac, exactly the checksum offset plus four.
 *
 * ### Survival is a second, separate file
 *
 * `GameMode == 4` additionally writes **twelve bytes** to `survival` from a
 * stack buffer: `SurvivalStage`, `Character1`, `SurvivalHealth`. That file has
 * no checksum and shares no layout with the main one.

 * a mismatch calls **`Reset_SaveData()`** and the fields are then re-validated
 * on top of the reset values. So a corrupt save is not rejected -- it is

 * ### The clamps encode the ladder lengths
 *
 *      Destiny     > 3 -> 0,  < 0 -> 0
 *      Character1  outside [0, 0x17] -> 1
 *      Stage       clamped to at most Destiny + 8

 * four ladders with 6, 7, 8 and 9 random opponents plus the two fixed bosses --
 * 8, 9, 10 and 11 fights for Destiny 0 through 3. Two functions written from
 * opposite ends of the save agree on the number without either stating it.
 *
 * Character 0x17 is 23, the slot `LoadFrontEndCharacters` loads as character 0.
 * The out-of-range fallback is **1**, not 0.
 *
 * ### The survival file is read asymmetrically
 *
 * `Write_SaveData` writes `{SurvivalStage, Character1, SurvivalHealth}`; this
 * reads `{SurvivalStage, SurvivalCharacter1, SurvivalHealth}`. The middle word
 * goes out of one global and comes back into a different one. Whether that is
 * deliberate is not established here -- it is transcribed because a port that
 * "fixes" it changes which character a resumed survival run uses.
 *
 * Health is clamped to (0, 100]: zero or negative and anything above 100 both
 * become 100, so a corrupt file resumes at full health rather than dead.
 *
 * Both files are freed after use. A missing `savedata` skips straight past
 * everything, including the survival load.

 * queue lives in `_EnduranceCharacters`, terminated by -1, and is mirrored into
 * three bytes of `_RoundParam` at +0x18, +0x19 and +0x1a.
 *
 * The default comes from `EnduranceMatchTable2[Destiny]`, two words a row: the
 * first becomes `Character2` and `PLAYER2MODEL`, the second the single queued
 * opponent. The queue is then closed with -1.
 *
 * ### `EnduranceTowerList` is eleven words a row -- again
 *
 * The index is `Stage + 11 * Destiny`, the same shape `FE_Task_VS_Screen_Init`
 * uses on `OpponentTowerList` and the same 44-byte row `PopulateTower` writes.
 * **A value of 2 in that list means a two-opponent endurance match**, and the
 * setup is derived from the 2 itself rather than looked up: `2 + 16` is the
 * fighter shown, and the queue becomes `{5, 15, -1}` with 15 being that
 * fighter minus three. Three constants from one table entry.
 *
 * ### GameMode 5 overrides everything with the treasure matches
 *
 *      TreasurePlayed == 7   three from EnduranceMatchTreasure7, by girlrand
 *      TreasurePlayed == 8   three from EnduranceMatchTreasure8, by boyrand
 *      TreasurePlayed == 9   a fixed queue: fighter 11 against 24 then 25
 *
 * The two random ones read **three consecutive entries of a four-wide row,
 * wrapping**: row `girlrand`, starting at `girlrand2 & 3`, then `+1` and `+2`
 * masked the same way. So the same three opponents always appear together and
 * only their order rotates -- it is a rotation, not a draw, exactly like the
 * ladder in `PopulateTower`.
 *
 * 24 and 25 in the third case are the same two fixed bosses `PopulateTower`
 * puts at the end of every ladder.
 *
 * Every path writes `-1` into the last queue slot and into `RoundParam + 0x1a`,
 * so the queue is always terminated even when it is shorter than three.

 * The two publisher splash screens, driven entirely by one frame counter,

 * the ones that draw nothing.
 *
 * The whole timeline, in frames:
 *
 *        0          load SPLASH1.PNG and SPLASH2.PNG, draw 1 at full alpha
 *        1 .. 120   SPLASH1, alpha 1
 *      121 .. 179   SPLASH1, alpha (180 - n) / 60      fading out
 *      180 .. 190   nothing drawn -- a deliberate gap
 *      191 .. 249   SPLASH2, alpha (n - 190) / 60      fading in
 *      250 .. 430   SPLASH2, alpha 1
 *      431 .. 489   SPLASH2, alpha (490 - n) / 60      fading out
 *      491 ..       delete both textures, CurrentTask = NextTask = 1,
 *                   Task_LoadingScreen(), delete LoadingTexture if present
 *
 * **The eleven-frame gap between the two logos is real**, not an artefact of
 * the fades meeting: 180..190 falls outside every drawing range. At 30 fps that
 * is about a third of a second of black, and it is what makes the two logos
 * read as separate rather than as a crossfade.
 *
 * All three fades divide by **60**, so each takes two seconds at 30 fps
 * regardless of how long the plateau either side of it is.
 *
 * ### Both orientation flags are forced sideways
 *
 *      limeDeferredDeviceSideways = 1
 *      limeDeviceSideways         = 1
 *
 * every frame, not once. So the splash cannot be rotated out from under itself
 * by anything else changing them.
 *
 * ### The sprite is a window into the texture, not the whole thing
 *
 *      limeDrawSprite(tex, 0, FE_YOffset,
 *                     480 * FE_WidthScale, 320 * FE_HeightScale,
 *                     0.03125f, 0.1875f, 0.9375f, 0.625f, colour)
 *
 * The four UVs are 1/32, 6/32, 30/32 and 20/32 -- an inset window, so the
 * shipped PNG is larger than the part that is shown and the margins are never
 * sampled. A port that draws 0..1 gets the logo surrounded by whatever the
 * padding contains.
 *
 * 480 x 320 is the device resolution written as literals and scaled at draw
 * time, which is how this survives a different screen.
 *
 * `limeSetColourMask(1, 1, 1, 0)` leaves the alpha channel unwritten -- the
 * fade is in the vertex colour, not in the framebuffer alpha.
 *
 * The colour block is written **twice**: copied from the function's own static
 * `{1, 1, 1, 1}` and then filled with four more explicit 1.0 stores before the
 * alpha is overwritten. Transcribed once; the duplication does nothing.

 *
 * The two speed lines are right-aligned (`align` 2) at
 * `limeScreenWidth - 8`, and **-8 is a raw pixel inset with no scaler on it** --
 * the same shape as the leaderboard's unscaled left margin and the dial's
 * unscaled P2 radius. Three separate places where one dimension of a pair is

 *
 * armv7 0x0001e3cc, 576 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Builds the raw six-button input word from the dial direction and the button
 * array, then converts the directions to facing-relative form.
 *
 * ### The dial is eight-way and diagonals set two bits
 *
 *      dir in {8, 1, 2}   |= 0x01   up
 *      dir in {4, 5, 6}   |= 0x02   down
 *      dir in {6, 7, 8}   |= 0x04   left
 *      dir in {2, 3, 4}   |= 0x08   right
 *
 * Each range is three wide and they overlap at the corners, so `dir == 2` sets
 * up **and** right. Direction 0 sets nothing -- neutral. Every test is written
 * as an unsigned range check (`subs` then `cmp ... #2`), which is how one
 * comparison covers three values.
 *
 * The six buttons are `buttons[0..5]` into bits 0x10 through 0x200 -- that is
 * the "6Button" in the name.
 *
 * ### This is the exact inverse of GetArcadeJoyBits' tail
 *
 *      if (LEFT)  set (facing & 0x10) ? 0x0800 : 0x1000
 *      if (RIGHT) set (facing & 0x10) ? 0x1000 : 0x0800
 *
 * 0x800 is TOWARD and 0x1000 is AWAY -- the same two bits `GetArcadeJoyBits`
 * converts back into LEFT and RIGHT on the way out, with the same facing flag.
 * **One function turns absolute into relative on input and the other turns
 * relative into absolute on output**, and neither makes sense without the
 * other. Both are needed, in that order, or the fighter mirrors his own inputs.
 *
 * The facing flag lives at `GameObjects[player * 16 + 0x0a]`, so the two
 * players' object records are sixteen bytes apart.
 *
 * ### 0x400 is edge-triggered
 *
 *      if (buttons[6] && LastSpecialButton[p] == 0) bits |= 0x400;
 *      LastSpecialButton[p] = buttons[6];
 *
 * The bit is set only on the rising edge, and the store happens on **every**
 * path including when the button is released -- so a port that only updates
 * `LastSpecialButton` when the button is down latches the bit forever.
 *
 * ### Fewer than six buttons goes back through GetArcadeJoyBits
 *
 * With `PlayerNNumButtons` at 4 or 5 the assembled word is run through
 * `GetArcadeJoyBits(bits, FourButtonMoves, facing & 0x10, 1)` to synthesise the
 * buttons the player does not have. At 6 nothing extra happens.
 *
 * The last argument is **1 in all four cases**, but spelled two ways: the
 * four-button arms compute it as `NumButtons - 3` and the five-button arms use
 * a literal 1. `NumButtons - 3` would be 2 at five buttons -- that expression is
 * simply never reached with a 5. Transcribed as the constant it always is.
 *
 * The four-button arms then fall through into the five-button test, which
 * cannot also be true. Dead, harmless, and left as written.
 *
 * ### Which player
 *
 *      isParentBasedOnSpeed()  ->  p = (the fifth argument != 0)
 *      otherwise               ->  p = (GameMode == 1)
 *
 * so in single player the player index comes from the game mode rather than
 * from the caller.

 *
 * ### Four call sites, one difference
 *
 * `RenderAnimatedCharacter` is called from four places in this function and
 * every argument but the last is the same. The last is its `visible` flag:
 *
 *      IsFrameVisible said yes, `flag` set      ->  0
 *      IsFrameVisible said yes, `flag` clear    ->  1
 *      character 12 on frame 295                ->  1, and a DIFFERENT name
 *      IsFrameVisible said no                   ->  whatever it returned
 *
 * The third is the per-character exception again -- **12 and 295, the same pair
 * `IsFrameVisible` special-cases** -- and here it does something concrete: the
 * name passed is `PlayerDefs[0x288]` rather than the fighter's own
 * `PlayerDefs[id].name`. A fixed entry, not indexed by character. So that
 * combination draws with somebody else's asset name.
 *
 * A `frameA` of -1 skips the draw entirely and goes straight to the cleanup.
 *
 * ### The attachment pass copies the whole palette first
 *
 *      memcpy(AttachTransforms, *MatrixPalette2, 0x1c20)
 *      LIME_RenderScene(6, anim->[0x10], frameA, frameB, t, 0, 0, 0,
 *                       skin, +0x52c, AttachTransforms)
 *
 * 0x1c20 is 7,200 bytes -- 150 matrices of 48, the 3x4 skin matrix this tree
 * already knows. So the attachment is posed against a **snapshot** of the
 * palette taken after the fighter was drawn, not against the live one; anything
 * that moves the palette between the two draws does not affect the attachment.
 *
 * Returns `p->anim->[0x34][1]`, read after everything else is done.

 *
 * armv7 0x00021c1c, 672 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Advances the background scene animation, **for both layers**, and fires their
 * event tracks. Returns immediately when `_ExtraEffects` is clear or the first
 * scene handle is null.
 *
 * ### Building the two matrices
 *
 *      RotMatrixX(M_Rot90, 1.5707964f)         <- PI/2, from the pool
 *      identity -> multiply by M_Rot90 -> scale by SceneScale
 *      translate by (SceneX, SceneY, SceneZ)   -> RealBGSceneMatrix[0]
 *      identity -> scale by SceneScale2
 *      translate by (SceneX2, SceneY2, SceneZ2) -> RealBGSceneMatrix[0x40]
 *
 * **Only the first layer gets the X rotation.** The second is built from a
 * fresh identity and never sees `M_Rot90`, so the two layers do not share an
 * orientation -- which is the sort of thing a port reproduces by accident only
 * if it copies the sequence rather than the intent.
 *
 * The translation is written **directly into elements 12, 13 and 14** of the
 * identity matrix before the multiply, not applied through a call -- the stores
 * are at `sp+0x40` with the matrix at `sp+0x10`, so they land on the
 * translation row of the 4x4. Reading those offsets as if they were relative to
 * the matrix pointer puts them past its end; gcc's `-Warray-bounds` caught
 * exactly that mistake here before it was committed.
 *
 * ### The per-layer loop
 *
 * For each layer, if its frame counter has crossed into a new integer it calls
 *
 *      LIME_TriggerEventsFromScene(handle, (long)frame, matrix,
 *                                  0, -1, LevelSelect == 2, 0, 0)
 *
 * -- and the second layer passes `0` where the first passes `0` too, but from a
 * different literal (`r3 = -1` then `adds r3, #1`), so the two call sites are
 * genuinely separate code rather than a shared tail.
 *
 * **`LevelSelect == 2` is passed as a flag to both.** Whatever stage 2 is, it
 * changes how the background events are triggered.
 *
 * Then the counter advances by exactly `1.0f` a call -- **not scaled by frame
 * time**, unlike `MaintainFESlide`. The background animation is therefore tied
 * to the frame rate, and a 60 fps port runs it at double speed unless this is
 * changed deliberately.
 *
 * ### Non-looping scenes stop on the last frame
 *
 * When `BGSceneLoops[layer]` is zero the counter is clamped to
 * `scene->count - 1` (`+0x44` of the scene, the same field `HUDANIM_Update`
 * reads) and the layer stops advancing. Looping scenes are never clamped here
 * at all -- the wrap happens inside `LIME_TriggerEventsFromScene`.
 *
 * The loop ends after layer 1, and layer 1 is skipped entirely when
 * `_BGSceneHandle2` is null -- which is the normal case for most stages and is
 * why the second layer went unnoticed for so long.

 * Draws Scorpion's spear -- the only thing in "extras" -- for both players, as
 * two face-me sprites: a stretched shaft and a fixed-size tip.
 *
 * Per player, and it is skipped entirely unless `_DrawSpear[player]` is set:
 *
 * ### The direction test is inverted by the mirror flag
 *
 *      mirrored (+0x540 set):  draw only while start.x <  end.x
 *      not mirrored:           draw only while start.x >= end.x
 *
 * The same +0x540 that flips the cull face in `RenderPlayer` and picks the
 * smoke offset in `DoSmokesSmoke`. Here it decides which way the spear is
 * allowed to point, so a spear travelling the wrong way for the fighter's
 * facing is simply not drawn.
 *
 * ### The shaft
 *
 * The texture is `SpearTexture[SpearWhichTexture[player] % 3]` -- **three
 * shaft textures cycled**, and the modulo is a reciprocal multiply with magic
 * `0x55555556` and no shift, which is 3 worked out numerically rather than
 * assumed.
 *
 * The sprite is stretched: its width argument is `start.x - end.x`, so it spans
 * whatever the spear currently covers, and its Y is
 * `ShadowOffset + 1.35` computed in **double** and narrowed at the call. The
 * 1.35 is a double literal in the pool, not a float widened.
 *
 * ### The tip
 *
 * A second sprite, drawn only when `SpearWhichTexture[player] % 3 <= 1` -- so
 * one of the three shaft phases has no tip at all. It uses
 * `SpearTexture[3]` or `SpearTexture[4]` and a width of **+0.25 or -0.25**,
 * chosen by comparing the same two X positions again and by whether
 * `SpearWhichTexture` is above 2. The sign is what points the tip.
 *
 * So `_SpearTexture` holds at least five entries: three shaft phases and two
 * tip orientations.
 *
 * Everything else in the long argument list is 1.0f or 0, written slot by slot;
 * the parameter names of `limeDrawFaceMeSpriteWH` are not established, so the
 * call below is transcribed positionally.

 * corners are scaled by `HUD_Scale`, both dimensions -- unlike the three
 * unscaled insets recorded in issue #22.

 * than anything computed.
 *
 * ### Three guards before either corner counts
 *
 *      FE_FadeAdd != 0                 no input during a screen fade
 *      limeTouchScreenX[0] != -1       only a RELEASE counts, never a hold
 *      DidIntroThisFrame               swallowed on the intro frame
 *
 * The fade guard is the same one `drawPage2x1Wide` and
 * `drawPage2x2BigForSettings` use, and it is re-tested **after** the pause
 * branch as well -- so opening the pause menu cannot also trigger the moves
 * list in the same frame.
 *
 * The click sound is `SFXHandle[0x1a]` at `MusicVol[Settings[3]] / 100`, the
 * same one `TouchAreaWH` plays on release.
 *
 * ### sendPause is called three times
 *
 * In `GameMode == 1` the state goes out **three times in a row** -- and the
 * first call's argument is whatever was already in r0, not `GamePaused`; only
 * the second and third read the global. Transcribed as written. Three sends for
 * one state change is what an unreliable link gets instead of an ack, and the
 * stale first argument suggests it was written that way rather than looped.

 *
 * The "waiting for the other player" screen. Draws the loading backdrop, one
 * centred line of text, and calls `syncGame(FrameCount)` every frame until it
 * returns 1.
 *
 * ### The text blinks on a 128-frame cycle
 *
 *      (FrameCount % 128) > 64  ?  <one string>  :  <the other>
 *
 * The modulo is signed and spelled out the way the compiler emits it
 * (`asr #31`, `lsr #25`, `add`, `and #0x7f`, `sub`) rather than as `% 128`.
 * Which pair of strings is used depends on `*startTime`:
 *
 *      startTime != 0    GameTextNoHeader(0x3b7)  alternating with `" "`
 *      startTime == 0    GameTextNoHeader(0x0e)   alternating with `" "`
 *
 * So it is a two-state blink between a message and a single space -- the
 * message flashes rather than animating, and the "%s" format is only there to
 * pass one or the other through `usprintf`.
 *
 * The result goes through `usprintf` into a stack buffer and then `limeUC` for
 * the BOM, which is three of the four functions in the UTF-16 chain used in one
 * line.
 *
 * ### FrameCount is frame-rate scaled, unlike BGSceneFrame
 *
 *      FrameCount += 1.0f / limeFPSScaleFactor
 *
 * -- the same `limeFPSScaleFactor` division `MaintainFESlide` uses, and the
 * opposite of `AnimateBG`, which adds a flat 1.0f. Two frame counters in the
 * same binary with different frame-rate behaviour; a port has to keep them
 * apart.
 *
 * ### On a successful sync
 *
 *      enableHeartbeat(10)
 *      CurrentTask = 6
 *      free the loading texture if it is still there
 *      if (Settings[2]) limePlayTune(LevelMusic[*LevelSelect],
 *                                    MusicVol[Settings[2]], 1)
 *
 * `_LevelMusic` is indexed by the selected stage, so each arena has its own
 * tune, and `Settings[2]` is the music volume index -- the same slot
 * `PlayFatalityVoice` reads. The volume is converted from the float table to an
 * int at the call.
 *
 * `FrameCount` still advances on the frame the sync succeeds.

 *
 * armv7 0x0001c8bc, 392 bytes.  **Complete**, and unusually opaque per byte --
 * fourteen arguments, four of which are only pinned down by what the arithmetic
 * does with them.
 *
 * ### Picking the frame
 *
 *      wrap != 0:   idx = first + ((last - first + 1) % abs(modulus))
 *      wrap == 0:   idx = first + min(last - first, modulus)
 *
 * The absolute value is `eor`/`sub` on the sign bit, and the modulo is a real
 * `__modsi3` call rather than a reciprocal multiply -- so the divisor is not a
 * constant here. **The two arms differ in kind, not just in clamping**: one
 * wraps and one saturates, and the caller's flag chooses between a looping
 * animation and one that holds its last frame.
 *
 * The frame number is `table[idx + 1]`, not `table[idx]`.
 *
 * ### The UVs are ratios against the record's own texture size
 *
 *      u0 =  record[0] / record[7]        v0 =  record[1] / record[8]
 *      u1 = -record[2] / record[7]        v1 =  record[3] / record[8]
 *
 * with **the mirrored path swapping which extent feeds u0 and u1**, and only
 * that. Everything else -- position, colour, the vertical pair -- is identical
 * between the two arms, so the whole mirror is one exchange of two divisions.
 *
 * The negation on `u1` is a `vneg.f32` on the unmirrored path only.
 *
 * ### The position
 *
 * The draw origin is built from the record's origin minus its anchor, with two
 * of the caller's scalars subtracted in:
 *
 *      x = record[4] - (record[9]  - arg4)
 *      y = record[5] - (record[10] - arg5)
 *
 * so the caller supplies a per-call offset that cancels part of the record's
 * own anchoring. Both are then scaled by the float in r2 and added to the
 * caller's x and y.
 *
 * Returns the frame index it used.

 * armv7 0x0001d844, 832 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Applies the current level's camera and player limits, then puts a row of
 * debug sliders on screen for them.
 *
 * ### Every arena has two halves, and `_CurrentScene` picks one
 *
 * The limits are read from **two separate sets of four fields** in
 * `_Level_Info`, chosen by whether `_CurrentScene` is zero. The debug labels
 * for the second set are literally the first set's with a `2` appended --
 * `"lx2"`, `"rx2"`, `"left cam margin2"`, `"right cam margin2"`.
 *
 * And the function prints `_UpperLowerTxt[CurrentScene]`, which names the two
 * states outright. **So a stage is not one space: it is an upper and a lower,
 * with independent camera bounds**, and `_CurrentScene` is which one the fight
 * is in. That is the Pit, the Subway and the Bell Tower -- the arenas with a
 * drop -- and it is why a port that treats a stage as a single camera volume
 * will get the limits wrong on exactly those.
 *
 * ### How the limits are derived
 *
 *      RoundParam[0] = (long)Level_Info[lvl].leftPlayerLimit
 *      RoundParam[1] = (long)Level_Info[lvl].rightPlayerLimit
 *      CamLeftLimit  =  (float)RoundParam[0] + leftCamMargin
 *      CamRightLimit =  (float)RoundParam[1] - rightCamMargin
 *      G[0xb0]       = RoundParam[0]
 *      G[0xb4]       = RoundParam[1] - 399
 *
 * The player limits are **truncated to int and then widened back to float**
 * before the margins are added, so the camera bound is quantised to whole units
 * even though the source field is a float. That rounding is visible only at the
 * edges of a stage and is easy to lose.
 *
 * The **399** is `0x18c + 3` -- written as two subtractions, not one constant.
 *
 * ### `blast_state` gates the whole thing
 *
 *      1 or 2   reset: CurrentScene = 0, RoundParam[9] = 0,
 *               ShadowOffset = 0, and fall through
 *      3        blast_state++ and fall through
 *      other    straight to the limits
 *
 * So the "blast" -- whatever knocks a fighter between the two halves -- resets
 * the scene and the shadow origin on its way through, and state 3 self-advances
 * every frame it is in.
 *
 * ### The sliders shipped
 *
 * Five `LIME_Slider` calls with their ranges, all live in the retail binary:
 *
 *      left playerlimit           -1280 .. 1280, step 6
 *      right playerlimit          -1024 .. 1280
 *      left cam margin             -300 .. 300
 *      right cam margin            -300 .. 300
 *      Shadow HeightFrom Ground      -4 .. 300
 *
 * The last one is `_ShadowHeightFromGround`, the same global
 * `RenderAnimatedCharacter` adds to the flattened shadow's height -- so the
 * developers tuned it live, and its slider range says they expected it small
 * and possibly negative.
 *
 * Ends with `LightPlayers()`.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------ SetToUseCamera
 *
 * armv7 0x00025d50, 900 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Places the camera. Takes an eye position and produces the eye, target and up
 * vectors for `LIMEDS_SetCameraOrientation` -- with the up vector a static
 * `(0, 0, 1)`, the same Z-up `HUDANIM_Render` uses.
 *
 * ### The camera lags by exactly one seventh
 *
 *      eye = (eye + LastEye * 6) / 7
 *      at  = (at  + LastAt  * 6) / 7
 *
 * Each frame it moves **one seventh of the way** to where it was asked to go.
 * That is the whole camera damping, and 6 and 7 are `vmov.f32` immediates, not
 * data -- there is no tuning global for it.
 *
 * It is not always on. The smoothing runs only when **all five** of these hold:
 *
 *      CurrentTask == 6            in the fight
 *      GamePaused == 0
 *      DoIntro == 0
 *      GameTime < 98.0
 *      blast_state is 0 or 4
 *
 * so the camera snaps rather than glides during the intro, while paused, in the
 * last stretch of the round, and through a stage transition. A port that damps
 * unconditionally gets a camera that drifts during the intro and refuses to cut
 * on a blast.
 *
 * `_LastEye` and `_LastAt` are written on **every** path, smoothed or not, so
 * the history is correct the moment smoothing turns back on.
 *
 * ### Two camera modes
 *
 *      NewCam == 0   at  = arg + (0, 0, SceneGroundOffset)
 *                    eye = at with Y reduced by exactly 1.0
 *
 *      NewCam != 0   at  = CameraLookAt + (0, 0, SceneGroundOffset)
 *                    eye = arg         + (0, 0, SceneGroundOffset)
 *
 * The old mode ignores `_CameraLookAt` entirely and pins the eye one unit
 * behind the target on Y; the new one takes both from globals. Both add the
 * same ground offset to Z only.
 *
 * ### SceneGroundOffset, and the smash
 *
 *      blast_state == 0    if RoundParam[0x30] != 0,
 *                          offset = -InitGroundOffset / WorldScaleAdjust
 *      blast_state 1 or 2  offset = (blast_player_height - player Y)
 *                                   / WorldScaleAdjust
 *      CurrentTask == 3    offset = 0, unconditionally
 *
 * The player Y is an `int16` read out of `_GameObjects` at `blast_state * 16 -
 * 0x0a`, so state 1 reads player one and state 2 reads player two -- the state
 * doubles as the player index.
 *
 * **The smash effect fires from inside the camera code.** Once the offset
 * reaches -1.5 or above and `_DoneSmashEffect` is clear, it copies the falling
 * player's matrix, zeroes its +0x38, plays `_SmashThruScene` through
 * `LIME_PlayFBXAtPos`, plays `get_tsound(0)` at the usual
 * `MusicVol[Settings[3]] / 100`, and sets the done flag. So the sound and the
 * particle burst for falling through a floor are triggered by the camera
 * noticing how far down the fighter is, not by the collision.
 *
 * Player two's matrix is at `Players + 0xb20 + 0x18` and player one's at
 * `Players + 0x548` -- 0xb20 being 0x548 + 0x5d8, which is neither the player
 * stride nor a round number. Transcribed as the two literals they are.

 *
 * armv7 0x0001bfe4, 1000 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Sets each player slot's light position and brightness, and publishes the
 * ambient for static meshes. Called at the end of `MaintainLevelScenes`.
 *
 * ### The light position comes from the level, per scene
 *
 *      CurrentScene == 0   Level_Info[lvl] + 0x00, 0x04, 0x08
 *      otherwise           Level_Info[lvl] + 0x34, 0x38, 0x3c
 *
 * -- a **third** pair of per-scene fields in that table, on top of the two
 * camera sets `MaintainLevelScenes` established. So the upper and lower halves
 * of an arena have independent lighting as well as independent camera bounds.
 *
 * The three components are copied into the player at +0x5d8, +0x5dc and +0x5e0,
 * and the same three multiplied by **255.0** become `_StaticMeshAmbient`.
 *
 * ### Four levels get distance-based brightness, and no two the same way
 *
 * Brightness starts at 1.0 in `p[0x5d4]` and four stages override it from the
 * fighter's Z (`p[8]`), each with its own reference height, falloff and step
 * count. All four floor at **0.7** and clamp at 1.0:
 *
 *      level 1   b = 1 + |z - 183/scale| / -10       one sample
 *      level 8   b = 1 + |z - 120/scale| / -11       one sample
 *      level 5   four samples from -630/scale, stepping 480/scale,
 *                b = 1 + |z - h| * -0.5, taking the BRIGHTEST
 *      level 4   scene 1: five samples from -550/scale, stepping 330/scale,
 *                         b = 1 + |z - h| / -3.5, brightest wins
 *                scene 0: falls into level 5's four-sample form
 *
 * The multi-sample cases are **lamps in a row**: each iteration measures the
 * distance to one light and keeps the largest brightness, which is why the
 * comparison is `if (candidate > current)` and not an accumulation. Level 4's
 * upper and lower halves have different numbers of lamps -- five and four.
 *
 * All the falloff arithmetic is done in **double** and narrowed only when
 * stored, including the `-0.5`, `-3.5`, `-10` and `-11` which are `vmov.f64`
 * immediates rather than pool constants.
 *
 * ### Per-slot texture selection
 *
 * Four flags on the player pick which texture goes into `p[0x528]`:
 *
 *      +0x530 non-null   that texture directly, and p[0x52c] = anim[0x28]
 *      +0x538 set        anim[0x1c], and all four corners set to 1.0
 *      +0x53c set        `_WhiteTexture`, corners to 1.0
 *      +0x534 set        anim[0x18], corners to 1.0
 *
 * They are tested in that order and each can overwrite the last, so the final
 * texture is whichever of the four flags is set **latest in the sequence**, not
 * the first one found.
 *
 * ### One slot is skipped by identity
 *
 * When `CurrentScene` is non-zero and the slot is index 0, it compares a signed
 * byte at `GameObjects + 0x0c` against the same byte at `GameObjects + 0x1c`;
 * equal means the two fighters are the same object and the lighting for that
 * slot is derived from `Players[0].anim[8]` instead. A mirror-match guard, in
 * the lighting.

 *
 * Turns the raw touch slots into dial and button state, once per frame, for one
 * player or two.
 *
 *      P2Controls = 0
 *      if (GameMode == 6) P2Controls = GameMode - 5      <- 1, written as 6-5
 *
 * so two-player controls are on exactly in mode 6, and the 1 is computed from
 * the mode rather than assigned.
 *
 * ### Each touch claims the NEAREST button, not every button it overlaps
 *
 * For each of the ten touch slots it measures the distance to all six button
 * positions, keeps the closest one inside a radius, and sets that button's
 * state. A slot whose X is -1 is skipped, and a button whose index is -1 is
 * skipped -- so an unused layout slot costs nothing.
 *
 * The search starts from **999.0f**, which is the "no button yet" sentinel; a
 * touch further than that from everything would be missed, and nothing on a
 * 480-wide screen can be.
 *
 * Because it is nearest-wins rather than any-overlap, **two adjacent buttons
 * can never both fire from one finger** -- but two fingers can each claim the
 * same button, and nothing here prevents that.
 *
 * ### The two players get different hit radii, and one is unscaled
 *
 *      player 1, single-player   (float)(long)FE_W(40.0f)   truncated to int
 *      player 1, two-player      FE_W(40.0f)                not truncated
 *      player 2                  52.0f                      no scaler at all
 *
 * Three behaviours from one function. The truncation is a real `vcvt.s32.f32`
 * followed by `vcvt.f32.s32` on the P1 path and it happens **only** when
 * `P2Controls` is clear, so turning on two-player controls silently changes
 * player one's button radius by up to a pixel.
 *
 * The flat 52 for player two is the fourth place in this tree where one side of
 * a pair is scaled and the other is not -- see issue #22 -- and the second in
 * the input path, after `CheckLeftDial`'s unscaled P2 dial radius. On the
 * original 480x320 screen `FE_W(40)` is 40 and 52 is simply a bigger target;
 * anywhere else they diverge.
 *
 * ### The state rings
 *
 * Before the scan, each of the seven button slots is copied into
 * `LastButtonStates` and then cleared, so a button not touched this frame is
 * released rather than sticky, and the previous frame is preserved for edge
 * detection. Slot 0 is done outside the loop, which then runs from 4 to 0x1c --
 * the same peeled first iteration `InitGameEvents` and `InitKodeScreen` use.
 *
 * `JoystickState` is `CheckLeftDial(player) + 1`, so the eight-way result 0..7
 * becomes 1..8 -- exactly the range `GetReal6ButtonJoyBits` tests, with 0 left
 * free for "no touch on the dial".

 *
 * armv7 0x0001ddc0, 732 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Draws the on-screen controls at half size, offset by the caller's origin.
 *
 * ### It rebuilds the live layout from the scheme every frame
 *
 *      Settings[4] == 4  ->  copy ButtonsPos4 into ButtonsPos
 *                  == 5  ->  ButtonsPos5
 *                  == 6  ->  ButtonsPos6
 *
 * all 6 entries x 5 words, and the copy is written as a **transposed** double
 * loop -- outer over the five words, inner over the six entries -- so it walks
 * the destination in 0x14 steps five separate times rather than once in
 * sequence. Same bytes, five passes.
 *
 * ### The dial position is derived, not stored
 *
 *      JoystickStatePosX = (long)JSIZE
 *      JoystickStatePosY = (long)(limeScreenHeight - JSIZE)
 *
 * so the dial sits `JSIZE` in from the left and `JSIZE` up from the bottom --
 * one constant placing it in the corner, and `_JSIZE` is 64.0 in the shipped
 * data. `CheckLeftDial` then hit-tests against this position.
 *
 * ### Opacity comes from Settings[6]
 *
 *      0 -> 0.5      1 -> 0.75      2 -> 1.0
 *
 * Three steps, written as two `it eq` blocks with 0.5 as the fall-through, so
 * any other value also gives 0.5.
 *
 * ### The atlas: pressed is the EVEN column
 *
 *      u0 = ((glyph & 3) * 2 + (pressed ? 0 : 1)) * 0.125
 *      v0 = (glyph / 4) * 0.25
 *      u1 = 0.125      v1 = 0.25
 *
 * Eight columns by four rows, and each button occupies **two adjacent cells** --
 * pressed on the even column, released on the odd one. The `+ 1` is the only
 * difference between the two draw paths, which the compiler emitted as two
 * near-identical copies of the whole call.
 *
 * The glyph id is `+0x0c` of the entry; the button index used for
 * `ButtonStates` is `+0x10`. They are separate fields, so the same artwork can
 * serve two logical buttons.
 *
 * ### Everything is halved
 *
 *      x = FE_X(originX) + (entry.x - entry.size / 2) * 0.5
 *      y = FE_Y(originY) + (entry.y - entry.size / 2) * 0.5
 *      w = h = entry.size * 0.5
 *
 * The `size / 2` centring uses the signed `(n + (n >>> 31)) >> 1` shape, and the
 * outer 0.5 is what makes this a preview rather than the live control.

 * literal the whole front end uses to start a fade out.
 *
 * **`KontinueTime` gets 19.999001f -- bit for bit the same odd literal
 * `InitKodeScreen` writes into `_KodeTime`.** Two unrelated countdowns sharing
 * one value that is neither 20 nor anything derived; whatever produced it was
 * used twice.
 *
 * Mode 5 is the only one that empties the front-end task stack rather than
 * pushing onto it.
 *
 * ### The arcade logging happens before the switch

 *      printf(..., (double)timeInGame)
 *
 * 0x754e and 0x754f are 30030 and 30031. `timeInGame` is truncated to an int
 * for the event and passed as a **double** to the printf on the very next line,
 * so the log and the analytics disagree about its precision.

 *      glRotatef(90, 1, 0, 0)
 *      glScalef(PlayerSize, PlayerSize, PlayerSize)
 *
 * `_PlayerSize` is the same 0.01015625 global `runtime/demo.c` uses for the
 * fighter-to-stage ratio, and the 90-degree X rotation is the same one
 * `HUDANIM_Render` applies -- the Z-up world meeting a Y-up mesh.
 *
 * ### Character 24 is drawn mirrored
 *

 *          glScalef(scale, scale, scale);
 *          glCullFace(GL_BACK);
 *      }
 *
 * The negation is `eor r0, r1, #0x80000000` and the cull flip goes with it --
 * the **fourth** place in this tree with that exact pairing, after
 * `RenderAMesh`, `RenderPlayer` and `RenderExtras`. Character 24 is one of the
 * two fixed bosses `PopulateTower` appends to every ladder, and it is the only
 * character with a hardcoded mirror in the intro.
 *
 * The per-character scale comes from `PlayerDefs[id] + 0x04`, so it multiplies
 * the global `PlayerSize` already on the matrix.
 *
 * ### Which fighters appear depends on IntroCamCount
 *
 *      player 1 drawn when  IntroCamCount > 1
 *      player 2 drawn when  IntroCamCount > 2 || IntroCamCount == 0
 *
 * so at 0 only player two, at 1 neither, at 2 only player one, and above that
 * both. `AnimateIntroCharacterPlayers1Frame` uses the same global to choose
 * which fighter's animation advances -- the two halves of one intro
 * choreography.
 *
 * ### Player two's translate is divided by the scale
 *
 *      glTranslatef(-IntroPlayer1PosX / PlayerSize,
 *                   -IntroPlayer1PosZ / PlayerSize, ...)
 *
 * because `glScalef(PlayerSize, ...)` is already on the matrix stack, so the
 * offset has to be pre-divided to land in the same units. Both components are
 * negated first: player two is placed by undoing player one's offset and going
 * the other way.
 *
 * Each fighter is followed by the same attachment pass `RenderPlayer` uses --
 * `memcpy(AttachTransforms, *MatrixPalette2, 0x1c20)` then
 * `LIME_RenderScene(6, ...)` -- so the attachment is posed against a snapshot
 * taken after the body was drawn.
 *
 * `p[0x534]` is cleared before each draw, and `p[0x528]` is set from
 * `anim[0x14]`, overriding whatever `LightPlayers` chose.

/* ------------------------------------------------- Task_LoadGeneralData
 *
 * armv7 0x00023910, 788 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * The boot loader for everything that is not a level: language, save data,
 * sound, the three fonts, the translated text, and the first task to run. It
 * is one straight line with two early-out branches parked at the end of the
 * function, so the ORDER below is the game's real start-up order and can be
 * read off directly.
 *
 * ## The language is chosen by whether EA shipped a terms-of-service URL
 *
 * `limeGetLanguage` fills `Language` from the device, and the very next thing
 * the function does is ask for the property `TOS_URL_<lang>`. If that property
 * is missing the code does `strcpy(Language, "EN")` and carries on. So the
 * list of languages the game supports is not a list anywhere in the code --
 * it is whichever `TOS_URL_*` keys exist in the property file. A device set to
 * a language EA never shipped legal text for falls back to English, and it
 * falls back BEFORE anything else reads `Language`, so the fallback also
 * chooses the font tables and the text file.
 *
 * `compareLanguages(1)` then saves the code and reports whether it differs
 * from the previous run. Only the changed path logs to EA's tracking; the
 * unchanged path just prints. Both converge on `InitAllGameData`.
 *
 * ## The game mutes its own music if the player is already playing some
 *
 *      if (limeCheckForUserMusic()) Settings[2] = 0;
 *
 * `Settings[2]` is the music volume index -- `FrontEnd.c` plays MainMenu.mp3
 * at `MusicVol[Settings[2]]`. Index 0 is the muted level. So a player who
 * started their own music before launching gets the game's soundtrack turned
 * off for them, once, at boot, and it is written into the settings rather
 * than applied as a temporary override: it survives into the next launch.
 *
 * ## The three fonts, and the two things done to each after loading
 *
 *      GameFont       MKFONT_0.PNG + MKFONT_1.PNG   mkfont_ipad.ft2  2048^2
 *      NameFont       NAMES_FONT.PNG                namefont.ft2      256^2
 *      CountDownFont  COUNTDOWNFONT.PNG             countdownfont.ft2 128^2
 *
 * Only the game font has a second atlas -- it is the one that has to carry a
 * translated character set. The other two pass NULL and limeCreateFONT skips
 * the second load.
 *
 * Each font then gets `spacing` and `fallbackAdvance` written by hand,
 * OVERWRITING what limeCreateFONT just put there (it sets spacing from its
 * own argument, which is 0 in all three calls, and fallbackAdvance to the
 * constant 8):
 *
 *      GameFont       spacing -4   fallbackAdvance 17
 *      NameFont       spacing -2   fallbackAdvance  6
 *      CountDownFont  spacing  0   fallbackAdvance 10
 *
 * Negative spacing is a kern-in: the game font pulls every character four
 * units back towards the previous one.
 *
 * ## mkunicode.txt REPLACES the game font's code table
 *
 * `limeCreateFONT` builds `codes`/`codesW` from the .ft2 file. This function
 * then loads `mkunicode.txt` and overwrites both, one glyph at a time, from a
 * file that is plain UTF-16LE: the loop starts at byte 2, which skips the BOM,
 * and reads two bytes per glyph. The wide table gets the whole code unit and
 * the byte table gets its low half.
 *
 * That is what makes a translated build possible without touching the .ft2:
 * the atlas keeps its glyph rectangles in file order and mkunicode.txt says
 * which Unicode character each rectangle is. Swap the text file and the same
 * atlas serves a different language.
 *
 * The name font goes the other way -- it has no unicode file, so its wide
 * table is built by widening its byte table, and the byte table is a constant
 * compiled into the binary: the digits, A-Z, a-z, and then
 * `-%:;@` a pound sign, `.,!?'&[]+/\"*()#<>~`.
 *
 * 87 characters and a terminator, memcpy'd as a fixed 0x58 bytes. See
 * docs/GAME-BUGS.md: the length is a literal, not the font's glyph count.
 *
 * ## The float that proves limeCreateFONT's signature
 *
 * The last argument is `0x3ea66666` for the game font and `0x3f800000` for the
 * other two -- 0.325f and 1.0f. Those are float literals, which is what fixed
 * `limeCreateFONT`'s last parameter from `int` to `float` in decomp/lime.
 *
 * ## Where the game goes next
 *
 *      NextTask        = 2
 *      FE_CurrentTask  = 0, or 0x24 when CheckForUnclaimedTreasure() is true
 *      CurrentTask     = 8
 *
 * so a player owed a treasure from a previous run is routed to front-end task
 * 0x24 instead of the main menu, before the menu has drawn once.
 *
 * ## The on-screen joystick is placed from the button size
 *
 *      JSIZE             = ButtonSize
 *      JoystickStatePosX = (int)ButtonSize
 *      JoystickStatePosY = (int)(limeScreenHeight - ButtonSize)
 *
 * One button-size in from the left and one up from the bottom -- the joystick
 * is anchored to the bottom-left corner with a margin equal to its own size,
 * and both coordinates are truncated to whole pixels. `ButtonSize` is a float
 * and the two positions are ints; the conversions are `vcvt.s32.f32`, so they
 * truncate rather than round.

 *
 * armv7 0x000265d4, 1020 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * The mirror of `QuitAsLose` above, and the two are worth reading together:
 * they share a shape, the same fade constant, and the same per-mode exits, but
 * the win path carries the whole arcade ladder inside it.
 *
 * ### The ladder ends when the stage passes Destiny + 8
 *
 *      Stage++
 *      if (Stage >= Destiny + 8) { ...tower cleared... }
 *
 * `Destiny` is which of the four towers is being played, and it is also the
 * OFFSET that makes each tower longer than the last: tower 0 ends after 8
 * fights, tower 3 after 11. One field doing two jobs, which is why `Destiny`
 * is reset to **-1** and not to 0 when the tower is cleared -- 0 is a real
 * tower and -1 is the "no tower" value the front end tests for.
 *
 * Clearing a tower does five things in order: unlocks achievement 0 if the
 * player never lost a round on tower 3, sets this tower's bit in
 * `achievementTracker[0x54/4]` and unlocks achievement 1 once all four bits
 * are set, arms an unclaimed treasure, pushes front-end task 0x24 (the same
 * task `Task_LoadGeneralData` routes to at boot when a treasure is owed), and
 * clears `GameStarted`, `Destiny` and `Stage`.
 *
 * `TreasureSelected` is set to **-1**, not to a treasure: the value is chosen
 * later, on the screen that awards it. `SaveUnclaimedTreasure(1)` is what
 * makes it survive a quit.
 *
 * ### Playing as character 5 five times in a row unlocks achievement 13
 *
 *      if (PLAYER1MODEL == 5 && ++winningStryk == 5) achievementsUnlock(13);
 *
 * The test is `== 5`, not `>= 5`, so the achievement fires on exactly the
 * fifth win and never again in that run -- and `QuitAsLose` zeroes
 * `winningStryk`, so it is five consecutive wins as that character. This is
 * checked on two separate paths (the arcade tail and the survival tail),
 * written out twice in the original.
 *
 * ### Survival
 *
 *      survivalWinStreak++, Player1Wins = 1, (*SurvivalStageP)++
 *      if (survivalWinStreak > 19) { achievementsUnlock(19); Write_AchievementsData(); }
 *      Write_SaveData()
 *      Character2 = TowerRand[abs(limeRand()) % 22]
 *
 * Twenty survival wins unlock achievement 19. The next opponent is drawn from
 * `TowerRand`, the same 22-entry shuffle table `PopulateTower` uses, so
 * survival can repeat an opponent -- there is no exclusion, just a fresh draw.
 *
 * **`abs()` before the modulo, not after.** `limeRand` returns a signed value
 * and the code negates it when negative *before* dividing, so the index is
 * always in 0..21. Taking `% 22` of a negative first would have given a
 * negative index and read off the front of the table.
 *
 * ### Survival writes the save file twice
 *
 * The survival branch calls `Write_SaveData()`, and the common tail below it
 * calls `Write_SaveData()` again because the mode is not 1. Harmless, but it
 * is two full writes of the save file on every survival win, and the port
 * should not copy the second one into a build that writes to slower storage.
 *
 * ### The arcade logging, and what it says about the analytics
 *
 *      EASDK_LogEventEnumEnumString(0x7554, 15, DestinyNames[Destiny],
 *                                   15, getLayoutName(Settings[4], Settings[5]))
 *      EASDK_LogEventEnumEnumString(0x754e, 15, DestinyNamesWin[Destiny],
 *                                   15, getStageName(Destiny, Stage))
 *      EASDK_LogEventEnumEnumStringNum(0x754f, 15, DestinyNames[Destiny],
 *                                      7, (long)timeInGame)
 *      printf("time spent:%f\n", (double)timeInGame)
 *
 * `0x754e` is the SAME event id the loss path uses -- the two are told apart
 * by the string, `DestinyNamesWin[Destiny]` here against `DestinyNamesLoss`
 * there, not by the id. EA also logs the button layout on a win and not on a
 * loss, so the layout data set is biased towards players who were winning.

 *
 * armv7 0x0001d178, 844 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * One frame of the loading screen: the background, one piece of advice, the
 * word "LOADING" and the percentage. `Task_LoadingScreen` calls it; the
 * prototype above this file's `Task_LoadingScreen` has been there since that
 * function landed.
 *
 * ### The background is drawn only once the texture has reached the GPU
 *
 *      if (LoadingTexture && LoadingTexture->name)
 *          limeDrawSprite(LoadingTexture, 0, 0, w, h, 0, 0, 1.0f, 0.75f, col);
 *
 * `TEXTURE+0x40` is the GL texture name, so the second half of that test is
 * "and it has actually been uploaded". A texture object that exists but has
 * not been given to GL draws nothing rather than drawing garbage -- which
 * matters here specifically, because this is the one screen that runs while
 * other textures are still being uploaded.
 *
 * **The V range stops at 0.75.** The image is 3/4 of its texture's height:
 * a 4:3 background in a square power-of-two atlas. A widescreen port that
 * replaces this art has to keep the same 0.75, or change it here as well.
 *
 * ### Which advice is shown
 *
 *      if (DrawRandomKode == 0 && Stage > 1)   drawKodeTip(randomKode)
 *      else if (Stage == 0)                    GameText(0x369)
 *      else if (Stage == 1)                    GameText(0x365)
 *      else                                    GameText(TipToDisplay + 0x365)
 *
 * **The flag reads inverted**: `DrawRandomKode` being SET is what suppresses
 * the kode tip, not what asks for it. Zero plus a stage past the first two is
 * what draws it. Whatever the name meant originally, the test in the binary
 * is the one above.
 *
 * Stages 0 and 1 get fixed strings -- the first two fights of a ladder, where
 * the player is most likely new -- and everything after that gets one of a
 * rotating set indexed by `TipToDisplay`, which is why the tips only start
 * varying once the player is past the opening.
 *
 * The chosen string is wrapped to `limeScreenWidth - 32` by
 * `CreateWrappedTextArrays` into `HelpSpiltText`, 256 bytes a line, and drawn
 * centred (`align 1`) at y = (line*16 + 132) * FE_HeightScale.
 *
 * ### Everything else is anchored to the far corner
 *
 *      "LOADING"   x = 8   * FE_WidthScale     align 0 (left)
 *      "%d%%"      x = w - 16 * FE_WidthScale  align 2 (right)
 *      both        y = h - 24 * FE_HeightScale
 *
 * The two share a baseline and sit at opposite ends of it. Note the y is
 * `limeScreenHeight - 24 * FE_HeightScale` and NOT `(h - 24) * scale`: the
 * screen height is used raw and only the inset is scaled, so the text stays
 * the same distance off the bottom edge on any screen. Getting that grouping
 * wrong is the classic way a port ends up with text off the bottom of the
 * display.
 *
 * ### The percentage is clamped, and the font is checked twice
 *
 *      sprintf(buf, "%d%%", percent >= 100 ? 100 : percent)
 *
 * so a caller that overshoots still shows 100%%, never 103%%.
 *
 * Both text draws are guarded by `GameFont.numGlyphs != 0` -- separately, with
 * the guard re-read between them. This function runs before
 * `Task_LoadGeneralData` has built the font, so on the very first loading
 * screen the guard is false and only the background is drawn. That is the
 * whole reason the check exists.

/* ----------------------------------------------------------- InitAllGameData
 *
 * armv7 0x00021224, 1044 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Despite the name this function does exactly one thing: it lays out every
 * on-screen touch button, for every control scheme, from the screen size.
 * `Task_LoadGeneralData` calls it once at boot and reads `ButtonSize` straight
 * afterwards to place the joystick, so the two have to be read together.
 *
 * ### Everything comes from one ratio
 *
 *      k = limeScreenWidth / 640.0f      the design width
 *      B = k * ButtonSize                the one-player button
 *      C = B * 0.66666698f               the two-player button, 2/3 as big
 *
 * 640 is the layout the art was authored for; `k` is what carries it to any
 * other width. **Only the width feeds the scale** -- the height is used for
 * positions but never for scaling, so a taller screen gets the same button
 * size and more empty space, and a wider one gets bigger buttons.
 *
 * ### ButtonSize is rewritten in place, so this must run exactly once
 *
 *      ButtonSize = C / 0.66666698f      ( == B, up to one rounding )
 *
 * The global it read is the global it overwrites. Called twice, every button
 * would be scaled twice. Nothing else calls it -- `Task_LoadGeneralData` is
 * the only caller -- but a port that adds a "resolution changed" path cannot
 * simply call this again: it has to restore the design-time `ButtonSize`
 * first. Note also the round trip through 2/3 and back rather than just
 * keeping `B`; the two agree to within a float rounding, and the code stores
 * the round-tripped one.
 *
 * ### The layouts
 *
 * Every array is 120 bytes: six records of five words, of which this function
 * writes three -- x, y and size -- and leaves the last two alone. The
 * one-player arrays step in units of B from the bottom-right corner:
 *
 *      x: SW-0.5B, SW-1.5B, SW-2.5B      y: SH-0.5B, SH-1.5B
 *
 *      ButtonsPos4   4 buttons   a 2x2 block in the corner
 *      ButtonsPos5   5 buttons   the block plus one to its left
 *      ButtonsPos6   6 buttons   a 3x2 block
 *
 * `CustomButtonsPos4/5/6` get exactly the same values -- they are the player's
 * editable copy -- and are then copied into `DEFAULT_CustomButtonsPos4/5/6`,
 * which is what "reset controls" restores. **All three copies are 120 bytes**,
 * including the four- and five-button ones, so the unused records travel too.
 *
 * The two-player arrays split the screen. Player 2 (`_2`) works leftwards from
 * the right edge exactly as above but in units of C. Player 1 (`_1`) works
 * leftwards from
 *
 *      M = (limeScreenWidth / 2) - 0.5f * C
 *
 * and then subtracts a **flat 48 pixels** before stepping. That 48 is the only
 * number here that is not scaled by anything -- on a 640-wide screen it is
 * 48px of dead space either side of the centre line, and on a 2048-wide one it
 * is still 48px. For a widescreen port it is the first constant to revisit.
 *
 * ### The same value computed twice
 *
 * `M - C - 48 - C` and `(M - 2C) - 48` both appear, for what is arithmetically
 * one number, and both are truncated to int separately. They can differ by one
 * unit when the float rounding falls badly. Both are kept below rather than
 * folded into one, because folding them would be a change and not a
 * transcription.

/* The records are the same 20-byte BUTTONPOS_STRIDE entries the touch code
 * above walks: word 0 x, word 1 y, word 2 size, word 4 the button id. This

 * the preset data. Every array is 120 bytes, six records, however many the

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- Task_GameInit
 *
 * armv7 0x0002e6f4, 1232 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * The task that builds a fight. It is a three-state machine driven by
 * `GameInitState`, and it runs once a frame like every other task -- the
 * loading is spread across frames so the loading screen keeps animating.
 *
 *      state 0   first frame: clear the players, reset the event system,
 *                GameInitState = 1
 *      state 1   one slice of loading per frame, then GameInitState = 2
 *      state 2   finish the loading screen, GameInitState = 0, and fall
 *                through into the fight setup
 *
 * **The fight setup is only reached from state 2** (or from an out-of-range
 * state), so states 0 and 1 return early and the long tail below runs exactly
 * once per fight.
 *
 * ### The loading bar is 52 steps
 *
 *      Task_LoadingScreen_DRAWSCREEN(1, GI_LoadCount * 100 / 52)
 *      done = GameInit_LoadABit(GI_LoadCount)
 *      GI_LoadCount++
 *
 * The division is the usual reciprocal multiply -- magic `0x4ec4ec4f` with a
 * shift of 36, which is exactly `1/52`. So `GameInit_LoadABit` is expected to
 * take **52 calls**, and the percentage is derived from that expectation
 * rather than from the function's own progress: if it finishes early the bar
 * never reaches 100 on its own, which is why state 2 redraws it at a literal
 * 100 before deleting the texture.
 *
 * ### Sixteen player slots, one word each
 *
 *      for (i = 0; i < 16; i++) ((long *)(Players + i * 0x5f0))[1] = 0;
 *
 * 0x5f00 / 0x5f0 = 16, which is the fourth independent confirmation of the
 * 0x5f0 PLAYER stride. Only `+0x04` is cleared -- the rest of each slot is
 * left as it was.
 *
 * ### Wins needed, by mode
 *
 *      mode 2 (training)   0, and no intro at all
 *      mode 4 (survival)   1
 *      mode 3 (karnage)    0, and KarnageScore = 0
 *      everything else     2
 *
 * Training is the only mode that clears `DoIntro`; every other mode sets it
 * and then runs **twenty-five frames of `AnimateIntroCharacterPlayers1Frame`
 * back to back** before returning, to settle the intro animation before the
 * first drawn frame. That is a visible cost at load time and a place a port
 * could stop early.
 *
 * ### Kode 0x13 in versus starts the match one round from the end
 *
 *      if (GameMode == 1 && theKode == 0x13) {
 *          RoundWins[0] = RoundWins[1] = WinsNeeded - 1;
 *          H[0] = H[1] = 1;
 *      }
 *
 * Both players at match point and both at one health: a one-hit-kill round.
 *
 * ### A treasure played in mode 5 rewrites the kode
 *
 *      if (GameMode == 5 && TreasurePlayed == 10) {
 *          theKode = TreasurePlayed - 9;      // 1
 *          puts("TREASURE PLAY IN DARK KOBAT MODE!");
 *      }
 *
 * `TreasurePlayed - 9` for a value the branch has already established is 10 --
 * so it is the constant 1 written as arithmetic, which suggests the branch was
 * once a range.
 *
 * ### Two identical debug prints
 *
 * `"ACTIVE EVENTS:%ld"` is printed before `LIME_KillAllEvents` and again after
 * `LIME_InitEventsManager`, from two separate copies of the same string, and
 * `dumpMem` walks `mpSpriteList` and `mpEventQueue` on every entry into state
 * 0. All of it is live in the shipped build.

 *
 * armv7 0x0002270c, 1364 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Puts every per-fight global back to its starting value. Most of it is a flat
 * list of zeroes; the interesting parts are the two places where it is not.
 *
 * ### G+0x368 and G+0x36c are health x 1.66
 *
 * Every kode branch writes a pair of numbers into the game state alongside the
 * health it sets:
 *
 *      health 100 -> 0xa6 = 166
 *      health  50 -> 0x53 =  83
 *      health  25 -> 0x29 =  41
 *
 * and the survival branch computes its one directly:
 *
 *      G->healthBar1 = Health[0] * 166 / 100
 *
 * 166, 83 and 41.5-truncated-to-41. **The two words are the health scaled by
 * 1.66**, which is the bar length -- 100 health drawn across 166 units. Five
 * independently written constants and one open-coded multiply all agreeing is
 * what settles it; from any one branch alone they are just numbers.
 *
 * ### Survival carries health between fights, and rescales it
 *
 *      SurvivalHealth = Health[0]          // whatever the last fight left
 *      if (SurvivalStage > 0 || Round != 0)
 *          G->healthBar1 = Health[0] * 166 / 100;
 *      else
 *          SurvivalHealth = Health[0] = 100;
 *
 * `Health[0]` is read **before** it is set, so it is the carry-over. Only the
 * very first round of the very first stage resets it. Note the bar is rescaled
 * from the carried health but `Health[0]` itself is left alone -- the fight
 * starts with the bar already short.
 *
 * ### Four handicap kodes, which are really two
 *
 *      0x13   both players to 1 health          (one hit kills)
 *      0x0d   100 against 50
 *      0x0e   100 against 25
 *      0x0f   100 against 50   -- identical to 0x0d in every branch
 *      0x10   100 against 25   -- 0x0e with the two sides SWAPPED
 *
 * Which player gets the short bar is decided by two network predicates:
 *
 *      0x0d, 0x0e, 0x0f    player 1 gets the big bar when
 *                          isParent() != isParentBasedOnSpeed()
 *      0x10                player 1 gets the big bar when
 *                          isParent() == isParentBasedOnSpeed()
 *
 * So `0x0d` and `0x0f` are byte-for-byte the same handicap under two different
 * kodes, and `0x10` is `0x0e` with the sides reversed. Whether the reversal is
 * the point of the kode or a slip is not established -- what is established is
 * that it is the only one of the four whose side rule differs.
 *
 * Using two predicates rather than one is how both machines in a network game
 * reach the same answer without exchanging anything: `isParent` is the session
 * role and `isParentBasedOnSpeed` is derived from the measured link, and their
 * agreement or disagreement is a value both ends compute identically.
 *
 * ### The babality bounce table
 *
 *      BabalityVel[0..7]    = 0
 *      BabalityHeight[0..7] = { 288, 256, 272, 256, 288, 272, 256, 288 }
 *
 * Eight entries each, written out one store at a time and deliberately out of
 * order in the original. Three distinct heights in a repeating pattern -- the
 * bounce is authored, not simulated.

/* -------------------------------------------------------------- RenderLevelBG
 *
 * armv7 0x00025168, 1564 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * The whole stage background: two scene handles, up to eight extra mesh
 * layers, and one special case for level 1. This answers
 * [issue #17](../../issues/17) -- the port draws the first scene only.
 *
 * ### The second scene is real, and it is drawn with its own transform
 *
 *      scene 1   glRotatef(90, 1,0,0); glScalef(SceneScale);
 *                glTranslatef(SceneX, SceneY, SceneZ)
 *      scene 2   the same matrix, then
 *                glTranslatef(SceneX2, SceneY2, SceneZ2);
 *                glScalef(SceneScale2)
 *
 * Scene 2's transform is applied **inside** scene 1's push, so its offsets are
 * relative: `SceneY2 = -978.0` puts it 978 units below the stage, in the
 * already-rotated and already-scaled space. The port has to reproduce the
 * nesting, not just the numbers.
 *
 * ### Both scenes are drawn TWICE, and the only difference is one argument
 *
 *      LIME_RenderScene(-1, handle, frame, frame, 0, 0, 0, **0**, 0, 0, 0)
 *      LIME_RenderScene(-1, handle, frame, frame, 0, 0, 0, **1**, 0, 0, 0)
 *
 * Argument `d` is 0 then 1 -- the opaque pass and the transparent pass. Four
 * `LIME_RenderScene` calls per frame when both handles are set. A port that
 * draws each scene once will lose either the solid geometry or the glass,
 * depending which pass it happens to reproduce.
 *
 * ### With no second scene, the first is still drawn twice
 *
 * `BGSceneHandle2 == 0` takes an early path that renders scene 1's two passes
 * and then rechecks both handles -- and since the check that got it there was
 * `handle2 == 0`, the recheck always sends it to the tail. So the shape is:
 *
 *      no handle       draw nothing
 *      one handle      draw scene 1, two passes
 *      two handles     draw scene 1 and scene 2, two passes each
 *
 * ### Each scene is gated on `blast_state` and `CurrentScene`
 *
 *      draw scene 1 if (blast_state in 1..2) || CurrentScene == 0
 *      draw scene 2 if (blast_state in 1..2) || CurrentScene == 1
 *
 * `CurrentScene` picks between them when `blast_state` is 0 or above 2, and
 * both are drawn during a blast. So the two scenes are **alternatives** most of
 * the time and simultaneous during the transition -- which is why a port that
 * only ever draws scene 1 looks correct on the stages where `CurrentScene` is 0
 * and empty on the others.
 *
 * ### The second placement matrix is computed and then thrown away
 *
 *      limeMatrixMult(RealBGSceneMatrix, translate(Scene*2 * SceneScale2),
 *                     RealBGSceneMatrix + 16);
 *      memcpy(RealBGSceneMatrix + 16, RealBGSceneMatrix, 64);
 *
 * The multiply writes the second matrix and the copy immediately overwrites it
 * with a copy of the first, so **on leaving this function the two halves of
 * `RealBGSceneMatrix` are identical** and the `Scene*2` offsets have reached
 * only the GL matrix stack.
 *
 * `AnimateBG` (above) computes the same second matrix, correctly, every frame.
 * Which of the two a reader sees therefore depends on the order the two
 * functions run in -- and `AnimateBG` is the one that means it. Transcribed as
 * written; that this copy exists at all is the finding.
 *
 * ### All four draws use `BGSceneFrame[0]`
 *
 * `AnimateBG` maintains **two** frame counters, one per layer, and advances
 * them independently with their own loop flags. Every `LIME_RenderScene` here
 * passes `BGSceneFrame[0]`. So the second layer's counter is kept up to date
 * and never used: scene 2 is drawn at scene 1's frame. A port that wires
 * `BGSceneFrame[1]` to the second layer is fixing something, not transcribing
 * it.
 *
 * ### Five debug sliders, still live
 *
 *      Scene2X, Scene2Y, Scene2Z   -1500 .. 500
 *      Scene2Scale                   0.1 .. 2.0
 *      ShadowOffset                    0 .. 20
 *
 * plus a `LIME_printf` of a divider line, every frame. The ranges are the
 * useful part: they say what the author considered plausible, and `-1500` is
 * what makes `SceneY2 = -978` an ordinary value rather than an outlier.
 *
 * ### Eight extra mesh layers per stage, from LEVEL_INFO
 *
 *      for (i = 0; i < 8; i++)
 *          if (*(long *)(rec + 0xd4 + i*4) && ((char **)(rec + 0x74))[i][0])
 *              RenderAMesh(0, 0, &LevelBGPos, IdentityMatrix, 0,
 *                          LevelBGTexture[((long *)(rec + 0xb4))[i]],
 *                          0, *MeshSetLayers[i], 0);
 *
 * That settles three arrays inside the 244-byte `LEVEL_INFO` record: **+0x74 is
 * eight `char *` names, +0xb4 eight texture indices, +0xd4 eight enable flags**
 * -- and `0xd4 + 8*4 = 0xf4`, exactly the stride, so the flags are the last
 * field in the record. A layer is drawn only when its flag is set **and** its
 * name is a non-empty string; either alone is not enough.
 *
 * ### Level 1 has a hand-written glass effect
 *
 * When `LevelSelect == 1`, layer 0 is absent and `ExtraEffects` is set, the
 * loop is interrupted by 32 additive passes of `MeshSet_LEVEL_01`:
 *
 *      alpha = (1.0 + i * -0.03125) / 10.0        i = 0 .. 31
 *      GlassWindowPos.y -= 40.0 each pass
 *      ...then GlassWindowPos.y += 1280.0         (32 * 40, restored exactly)
 *
 * Thirty-two stacked translucent copies of one mesh, each 40 units lower and
 * one thirty-second fainter, drawn additively with depth test and depth writes
 * off. That is a volumetric shaft built out of slices -- and `-1/32` with 32
 * iterations means the last slice has alpha `(1 - 31/32) / 10`, just above
 * zero. `TestScale` is 0.0095 during it and 0.01 after, and the position is
 * restored exactly, so nothing leaks into the next frame.
 *
 * This is the single most expensive thing in the background: 32 draw calls for
 * one effect on one stage.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------- DrawMoveListIcons
 *
 * armv7 0x0001e60c, 1856 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Draws one move's input sequence as a row of button icons. This is the
 * function behind [issue #5](../../issues/5), and it settles the half of that
 * issue that needed settling: **the icon alphabet**.
 *
 * ### The printf in issue #5 is the first line of this function
 *
 *      printf("%d\n", seq[0]);
 *
 * Unconditional, every frame, first thing. That is the source of the 10,208
 * bare-number lines in the touchHLE log -- and it prints **only `seq[0]`**, not
 * the whole sequence. The periodicity in the log is the screen being redrawn,
 * not the sequence being walked, so a run of period 6 is a six-frame animation
 * cycle in the caller, not a six-input move.
 *
 * That changes what the capture in issue #5 is worth: it gives the FIRST input
 * of each move, repeated, not the input list. The list is `seq`, and the way to
 * read it is the table below.
 *
 * ### The icon alphabet: a 4x4 atlas, all sixteen cells used
 *
 * Values 0 to 15 index `MoveIconsTexture` by writing a `(u, v)` pair, each from
 * {0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75}, and drawing a quarter-by-quarter cell. Sixteen values,
 * sixteen cells, one each:
 *
 *          u=0     u=0.25   u=0.5   u=0.75
 *      v=0     0       1        2       3
 *      v=.25   4       5        9       8
 *      v=.5   13       7        6      14
 *      v=.75  12      11       10      15
 *
 * Value 0 reaches cell (0,0) the same way an out-of-range value does -- the
 * range check is `(unsigned)(value - 1) > 21`, so 0 wraps into the default --
 * but 0 is a real value that appears throughout the move tables, so cell (0,0)
 * is a real glyph and not a blank. The first row is 0, 1, 2, 3 in order and the
 * rest is not, which says the atlas was laid out by hand.
 *
 * Each icon is drawn `16 x 16` design units scaled by `FE_WidthScale` and
 * `FE_HeightScale`, two units above the row's baseline, and the cursor advances
 * **17** units -- one unit of gap.
 *
 * ### Values 16 to 22 are text, not icons
 *
 *      16   GameTextNoHeader(0x3a8)
 *      17   GameTextNoHeader(0x3a9)
 *      18   "("
 *      19   ") "
 *      20   "/"
 *      21   GameTextNoHeader(0x3aa)
 *      22   GameTextNoHeader(0x3f9)
 *
 * So a move's notation can contain brackets and a slash -- "(x / y)" style
 * alternatives -- and four translated words. Those seven values will never
 * appear as button inputs in the fight engine; they are punctuation for the
 * display. Anyone decoding a captured sequence has to split the alphabet at 15.
 *
 * Text advances by `limeGetStringWidth * 0.75 * FE_WidthScale` and is drawn at
 * scale `0.75 * FE_WidthScale`, so the punctuation is three-quarter size next
 * to the icons.
 *
 * ### The two directions are the same dispatch written twice
 *
 *      rightAlign == 0   caption first, then icons left to right from FE_X(48)
 *      rightAlign != 0   icons first, then the caption, anchored to
 *                        limeScreenWidth - FE_X(48) and walked BACKWARDS
 *
 * The sequence reads left to right on screen either way -- only the anchor and
 * the order of the caption differ. The 22-way dispatch, the atlas coordinates
 * and the advance are duplicated in full for the two cases; roughly two thirds
 * of this function's 1856 bytes are that duplication.
 *
 * The caption is wrapped as `"(%s)  "` and skipped when `limeFontStrLen`
 * returns 0.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------ GameInit_LoadABit
 *
 * armv7 0x0002b940, **11,700 bytes** -- the largest function in `gamecode`.
 * **Complete.**
 *
 * One slice of fight loading per call. `Task_GameInit` calls it with
 * `GI_LoadCount` and stops when it returns non-zero; the body is a 53-way
 * `tbh` on that counter, `0 .. 0x34`. **Only step 52 returns 1.** Every other
 * step returns 0, including the ones that find nothing to do -- so a skipped
 * step costs one frame and nothing else.
 *
 * It is worth reading as three things at once: the **asset manifest for a
 * fight**, the **map of the LEVEL_INFO record**, and the **character index
 * table**.
 *
 * ## The roster, settled six ways
 *
 * Four steps are 24-way switches picking a per-character stage-death scene, and
 * all four order the characters identically. `_CharacterNames` (0x0014fe54, an
 * array of `char *`) then names them, and it runs to 26 -- exactly the
 * `FE_CHARACTER_SLOTS` that `Players.c` measured from a symbol gap and
 * `Task_FEDestroy` measured from a texture array:
 *
 *       0 KANO         7 SEKTOR      14 SMOKE        21 SUB-ZERO (classic)
 *       1 SONYA        8 CYRAX       15 KITANA       22 SMOKE (classic)
 *       2 JAX          9 KUNG LAO    16 JADE         23 NOOB SAIBOT
 *       3 NIGHTWOLF   10 KABAL       17 MILEENA      24 MOTARO
 *       4 SUB-ZERO    11 SHEEVA      18 SCORPION     25 SHAO KAHN
 *       5 STRYKER     12 SHANG TSUNG 19 REPTILE
 *       6 SINDEL      13 LIU KANG    20 ERMAC
 *
 * That closes a set of loose ends across the whole tree at once:
 *
 *   - `defeatedBySK` in `QuitAsLose` counts losses to `PLAYER2MODEL == 25`.
 *     **25 is Shao Kahn.** The variable was named for him and it checks out.
 *   - `QuitAsWin` and `FE_Task_Main_Menu` count a streak in `winningStryk`,
 *     gated on `PLAYER1MODEL == 5`. **5 is Stryker** -- the odd variable name
 *     is the character's.
 *   - `FE_Task_Character_Select` sets `Character2 = 0x19` for karnage and for
 *     mode 5. That is Shao Kahn as the fixed opponent.
 *   - the death switches stop at 23, so **Motaro and Shao Kahn have no stage
 *     death** -- they are bosses, not selectable fighters.
 *   - `Stats[PLAYER1MODEL + 15]++` below is the per-character play counter, and
 *     `FE_Task_Stats` scans **23** of them starting at word 15. Characters 23,
 *     24 and 25 are counted and never scanned, so Noob Saibot can never be your
 *     "most played".
 *
 * ## The LEVEL_INFO record, mostly mapped
 *
 * Steps 27 to 30 and 51 read most of the 244-byte record. With the three arrays
 * `RenderLevelBG` settles, the map is now:
 *
 *      +0x0c .. +0x18   SceneX, SceneY, SceneZ, SceneScale   (floats)
 *      +0x1c            scene 1 filename        (char *)
 *      +0x20            scene 1 loop flag
 *      +0x24, +0x28     ground offsets, float -> int
 *      +0x40 .. +0x4c   SceneX2, SceneY2, SceneZ2, SceneScale2
 *      +0x50            scene 2 filename
 *      +0x54            scene 2 loop flag
 *      +0x58, +0x5c     ground offsets used when BOTH scenes exist
 *      +0x74 + i*4      eight extra-layer mesh names   (char *, "" = absent)
 *      +0x94 + i*4      eight extra-layer texture names
 *      +0xb4 + i*4      eight texture indices
 *      +0xd4 + i*4      eight enable flags               (0xd4 + 32 = 0xf4)
 *
 * **`CurrentScene` is set to 1 exactly when both `+0x1c` and `+0x50` are
 * non-null**, and that same branch is the only thing that writes
 * `SceneX2..SceneScale2`. So the second background layer `RenderLevelBG` draws
 * is enabled by the stage data carrying two scene filenames and by nothing
 * else -- which answers the last open question in
 * [issue #17](../../issues/17).
 *
 * ## Two stages have per-character deaths
 *
 *      LevelSelect == 4    SUBWAY_<CHARACTER>.scene
 *      LevelSelect == 11   LAIR_<CHARACTER>.scene
 *
 * Step 46 loads player 1's into `TrainDie1Scene` and step 47 player 2's into
 * `TrainDie2Scene`; steps 44 and 45 do the same pair for the lair into
 * `SLDie1Scene` and `SLDie2Scene`. In endurance the second slot comes from
 * `LastEnduranceCharacter` rather than `Character2`, so the death matches
 * whoever is actually on screen.
 *
 * Forty-eight scene files for two stages, which is why they are the two most
 * expensive stages to enter.
 *
 * ## The manifest, in load order
 *
 *      2      FE_BUTTONS_01.PNG
 *      3-12   FATAL_HUDGFX_0..9.PNG      ten frames, ONE PER STEP
 *      13     MOVES_ICONS.PNG            the atlas DrawMoveListIcons indexes
 *      14     DANGER.PNG
 *      15     LOGO_COIN_32.PNG
 *      16     LoadBloodTextures()
 *      17     BLOODSPLAT1 / GREENBLOODSPLAT1 / BLACKBLOODSPLAT1 / SMOKEPARTICLE2
 *      18     InitParticles, InitGameEvents, STARFIELD / EARTH_128 / EXPLOSION_0
 *      19-20  SPEAR1..4, TRIDENT4
 *      21-26  WHITE, PAUSE, INFO, X, HUD_TPAGE, PAUSEBG, BUTTONS_TPAGE
 *      27-28  the stage's two scenes, from LEVEL_INFO
 *      29-30  the eight extra layers' textures and meshes
 *      31-32  FIGHT.meshset, FIGHT.scene
 *      33-40  SHOCKWAVE2, JAXZAP8, GENERICBLOODEXPLODE, XEROX,
 *             GENERICBODYEXPLODE, ROCKFALL, SUBWAY_TRAIN, ROCKBREAKTHROUGH
 *      41     SK_ENDING.scene, outside endurance only
 *      48     LoadLevelCharacters(PLAYER1MODEL, PLAYER2MODEL)
 *      49-50  PreloadGameCharacters for endurance, and for Stryker
 *      52     LoadAllSounds, mk3_init, and the return of 1
 *
 * **Ten separate steps to load ten HUD frames** is the clearest statement of
 * what the counter is for: the work is chopped so no single frame stalls, and
 * the 52 in `Task_GameInit`'s progress bar is a budget, not a measurement.
 *
 * ## Stryker drags three other characters in
 *
 * Step 50 fires when either fighter is character 5 and fills
 * `StrykerCharacters` with `{ 2, 3, 13, -1 }` before preloading them -- Jax,
 * Nightwolf and Liu Kang. They are loaded whether or not they are in the fight,
 * so Stryker costs three extra character loads.
 *
 * ## Cyrax's self-destruct is loaded only when it can happen
 *
 *      if (either fighter is 0, 8 or 11)
 *          CyraxSelfDestructScene = "PURPLEHAZEDEATH.scene"
 *      else
 *          CyraxSelfDestructScene = NULL
 *
 * 0, 8 and 11 are Kano, Cyrax and Sheeva. The scene is Cyrax's, so the other
 * two are on the list as the ones it can be used against.
 *
 * ## The AI flag is bit 7 of the model index
 *
 * Step 52 hands the fight engine its fighters:
 *
 *      AIOn == 0   mk3_init(P1,        P2,        FrameID_GetBBox, 1)
 *      AIOn == 1   mk3_init(P1,        P2 | 0x80, FrameID_GetBBox, 1)
 *      AIOn == 2   mk3_init(P1 | 0x80, P2 | 0x80, FrameID_GetBBox, 1)
 *
 * which is exactly the three states `ShowDebugInfo` prints as "Human vs Human",
 * "Human vs CPU" and "CPU vs CPU". **The engine is told a fighter is CPU by
 * setting bit 7 of its character index**, so a model index is seven bits wide
 * and the roster's 26 entries have plenty of room.
 *
 * Then `mk3_set_four_button(side, buttons != 6)` for each side, from
 * `Settings[4]`: the fight engine only distinguishes six-button from
 * everything-else.
 *
 * ## One number worth checking
 *
 *      Camera[0] = TestScale * 0.0;
 *      Camera[1] = TestScale * -1200.0f;
 *      Camera[2] = TestScale * 146.0f;
 *
 * The declaration of `Camera` further up this file records an observed
 * `(0.0, -600.0, 146.0)`. That would need `TestScale` to be 0.5 for the Y and
 * 1.0 for the Z, and it cannot be both. This is the write that runs at fight
 * start; whichever of the two is wrong, they disagree.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------- MovesList
 *
 * armv7 0x0001ed4c, 8,796 bytes.  **Complete**, with one qualification recorded
 * at the end of this comment.
 *
 * The in-game Moves Info screen: ten pages of "notation on the left, move name
 * on the right", with a button at the bottom that advances the page.
 *
 * The tables it displays are static data, documented in
 * [MOVES-TABLES.md](../../docs/MOVES-TABLES.md) and readable with
 * `tools/moves.py`. This function is how they are sliced and drawn.
 *
 * ### Five pages, or ten in two-player
 *
 *      if (DrawButtonNew(&BUTTON_BACK, 0x1a7, 0x130, 1)) {
 *          MoveListPage++;
 *          MoveListPage %= (GameMode == 6) ? 10 : 5;
 *      }
 *
 * Pages 0-4 are player 1's list and 5-9 player 2's, so the second half is only
 * reachable in mode 6 -- two players on one device. Both moduli are reciprocal
 * multiplies in the original.
 *
 * The button asset is `BUTTON_BACK` and it moves **forward**. There is no way
 * back except all the way round.
 *
 * ### What each page shows
 *
 *      0, 5   Generic moves, rows 0-5      names GameTextNoHeader(row + 0x124)
 *      1, 6   Generic moves, rows 6-11     the same base
 *      2, 7   Generic moves, rows 12-16    the same base
 *      3, 8   the character's section 1    from MovesListTab
 *      4, 9   the character's section 2    from MovesListTab
 *
 * The shared moves are three pages of six -- `Generic_Moves` is seventeen rows,
 * which is why the third is short -- and the character's own are two.
 *
 * **`MovesListTab`'s section 3 is never displayed.** Fourteen of the twenty-
 * three characters have one (Sonya's is seven rows) and none of the ten pages
 * reads words 10, 11 or 12 of the entry. Whatever section 3 is for, it is not
 * this menu, and `tools/moves.py` prints it because the data is there.
 *
 * ### The two id ranges are the name and the qualifier
 *
 * Each `MovesListTab` section carries two `GameText` bases, and this function
 * settles what they are:
 *
 *      GameTextNoHeader(idA + row)   drawn as text -- the move's NAME
 *      GameTextNoHeader(idB + row)   handed to DrawMoveListIcons as its caption
 *
 * and `DrawMoveListIcons` wraps a caption as `"(%s)  "`. So idB is the
 * parenthesised qualifier that follows a move name. One range per column.
 *
 * ### The row is drawn as a stripe, and the anchor alternates
 *
 *      limeFillRect(0, (y + 0x2f) * FE_HeightScale,
 *                   limeScreenWidth, 32.0f * FE_HeightScale,
 *                   shade, shade, shade, 0.7f)
 *
 * with `shade` **0.0 on even rows and 0.15 on odd** -- both bars are drawn, at
 * the same height and the same 0.7 alpha, and the alternation is the only
 * difference. That is the banding behind the list.
 *
 * The move name is drawn **right-aligned at `FE_X(432)`** at three-quarter
 * scale, and the notation starts from `DrawMoveListIcons`'s own `FE_X(48)`.
 *
 * And then the surprising part: the fourth argument to `DrawMoveListIcons` --
 * the one that anchors the notation to the right edge instead of the left --
 * is `(row + 1) & 1`, **the same alternation as the stripe**. So consecutive
 * rows anchor their notation at opposite ends of the screen. It is written out
 * once and used for both, in a single `ands` before the branch, so it is not a
 * transcription slip on this side; whether it was one in the original is not
 * something the disassembly can say.
 *
 * ### The y counter doubles as the row offset
 *
 *      seq = table + (y << 1)
 *
 * `y` steps by 0x20 a row, so `y << 1` steps by 0x40 -- exactly the 64-byte row
 * stride. One counter, two uses, no multiply. Worth knowing before anyone
 * tidies the loop.
 *
 * ### The guest shows the other player's moves
 *
 *      if (GameMode == 1 && !isParentBasedOnSpeed())
 *          character = PLAYER2MODEL;
 *
 * On the machine that is not the speed-elected parent the local player *is*
 * player 2, so that is the list it shows.
 *
 * ### Ten unrolled copies, and what was read
 *
 * The ten pages are ten separate blocks of 690 to 830 bytes, differing only in
 * the starting row, the section and which player. That duplication is most of
 * the 8,796 bytes.
 *
 * **Pages 0 and 3 were read instruction by instruction**; the other eight were
 * established from their distinguishing constants -- the starting row, the
 * table symbol, the id base and the header id -- which is what differs. The
 * shared row-drawing below is page 0's and page 3's, verified twice.

/* --------------------------------------------------------------------- DrawHUD
 *
 * armv7 0x000282dc, 11,536 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * The largest function in `gamecode`, and its name is a lie: `DrawHUD` runs the
 * **round and match state machine**. Deciding who won the round, awarding the
 * flawless, starting the next round, loading the next endurance opponent and
 * ending the match all happen here, in among the health bars and the combo
 * counter. `QuitAsWin`, `QuitAsLose`, `ResetFightData`, `mk3_init`,
 * `InitEnduranceMatch` and `LoadGameCharacterCheckCache` are all called from
 * inside it.
 *
 * Anything porting the fight loop has to know that. This is not a call you can
 * reorder, skip a frame, or move onto a render thread.
 *
 * The original is one flat function: the two player halves, the two combo
 * counters and the two round-end halves are each written out twice in full,
 * which is most of the 11,536 bytes. They are folded into helpers here. Every
 * constant is the original's, and where the two copies differ the difference is
 * called out.
 *
 * The block layout is heavily reordered -- the `return` sits at 0x00028f12 with
 * a dozen cold blocks after it that jump back into the body -- so the control
 * flow below comes from tracing branches, not from reading the range in order.
 *
 * ### The game modes, finally pinned down
 *
 * Six modes disambiguate each other across this one function:
 *
 *      0   Arcade / tower            `winStreak`, the tower completion logging
 *      1   Network                   `isParentBasedOnSpeed`, `updateMPWins`
 *      2   Training                  the only caller of `TrainingMessages`
 *      3   Karnage                   draws `KarnageScore`, and is the one mode
 *                                    that does NOT draw player 2's plate
 *      4   Survival                  `survivalWinStreak`
 *      6   Two players, one device   logged as the literal "2 Players on 1 iPad"
 *
 * Mode 5 never appears here.
 *
 * ### The bars are the depleted part, drawn with a negative width
 *
 * `limeDrawSprite`'s last four floats are UV **extents**, not corners: the
 * plate is 192x28 at 0.75 x 0.109375, and 192/256 and 28/256 are exactly those.
 * The atlas is 256x256. Player 1, all times `HUD_Scale`:
 *
 *      plate    x 18   y 24   w  192   h 28   uv (0, 0)         ext (.75, .109375)
 *      health   x 209  y 24   w -190*  h 20   uv (1/256, .125)  ext (1/256, 20/256)
 *      run bar  x 81   y 44   w  -62*  h  7   uv (.125, .125)   ext (1/256, 7/256)
 *
 *      * scaled by (100 - Health) / 100 and (100 - RunBar) / 100
 *
 * The two bar widths are **negative**, so each rectangle runs leftward from its
 * x. They do not draw the bar -- the full bar is painted into the plate -- they
 * draw the *depleted* part over it, growing leftward from the right end. 209 is
 * the plate's right edge (18 + 192 = 210), 190 is very nearly the bar's full
 * width, and the source is one pixel of UV width stretched across the
 * rectangle. Health sits in the plate's top 20 rows and the run meter in the
 * 7 below it, which is the whole 28.
 *
 * Player 2 is the mirror: every x becomes `limeScreenWidth - x`, and the widths
 * come out **positive** so they grow rightward instead. The name flips from
 * left- to right-aligned. The coins keep a positive width and move their left
 * edge, so 18 and 50 become -50 and -82 -- the same 32-pixel pitch measured
 * from the other side.
 *
 * ### The combo counter slides in, and retracts in two stages
 *
 *      x = (128 - ComboSlider1[p]) * HUD_Scale                     player 1
 *      x = limeScreenWidth - (128 - ComboSlider1[p]) * HUD_Scale    player 2
 *      y = 108 * HUD_Scale   hit count,  GameTextNoHeader(0xb5)
 *      y = 124 * HUD_Scale   damage,     GameTextNoHeader(0x11c)
 *
 * `ComboTimer`, `ComboNumber`, `ComboDamage`, `ComboSlider1` and `ComboSlider2`
 * are all **two-element arrays**, one per player -- the second element is only
 * ever reached as `[r3, #4]`, which is why nothing found them before. Above a
 * timer of 60 both sliders run on together at 8 a frame; below it they retract,
 * and `ComboSlider2` does not start until `ComboSlider1` is past 64. That
 * stagger is the damage line trailing the hit line off the screen.
 *
 * ### Round end
 *
 * Two symmetric halves, each guarded by the same `RoundSummary == 0`, so only
 * the first to fire in a frame counts:
 *
 *      Health[0] == 0  ->  player 2 takes the round
 *      Health[1] == 0  ->  player 1 takes the round
 *
 * and a third path when the clock runs out, where the higher health wins and an
 * exact tie gives the round to nobody. A timeout win at 100 health keeps the
 * flawless streak; any other win below 100 clears it.
 *
 * Reaching `WinsNeeded` calls `updateMPWins()` and stops there. The match end
 * itself is driven later, from the summary timer.
 *
 * ### Three kodes are implemented here
 *
 * - **`theKode == 1` is Blackout.** `lightsOn` counts down a frame at a time and
 *   at zero the screen is filled solid black -- *unless* `IsInFinishing`, so the
 *   lights come back up for the fatality. That exception is the whole point of
 *   the kode.
 * - **`theKode == 0x13` ends the match in one round.** In a network game the
 *   loser's `RoundWins` is set to `WinsNeeded` and the winner's to
 *   `WinsNeeded - 1`, so the very next test ends the match. Both halves do it,
 *   and the coin display reads the other player's counter to match.
 * - **`theKode == 0x11`** suppresses both plates: the bars, both names and the
 *   clock. The coins still draw.
 *
 * ### Achievements, and what earns them
 *
 *      2     a flawless round                    modes 0 and 4
 *      3     five flawless victories             modes 0 and 4
 *      6     a combo above four hits             modes 0 and 4
 *      0xe   beating Motaro (PLAYER2MODEL 24)
 *      0x10  beating Shao Kahn (PLAYER2MODEL 25)
 *      0x13  a survival streak above 19
 *
 * The two boss indices land exactly where [ROSTER.md](../../docs/ROSTER.md) put
 * them, reached from a direction that table did not use.
 *
 * ### Four stats counters, named
 *
 *      Stats[6]    flawless victories
 *      Stats[12]   accumulated fight time, as 99 - GameTime a round
 *      Stats[13]   accumulated health kept
 *      Stats[14]   rounds fought
 *
 * In a network game `Stats[13]` takes `Health[isParent() ? 0 : 1]`, because the
 * local player is player 2 on the guest. Everywhere else it is `Health[0]`.
 *
 * ### The round banners are hardcoded English
 *
 * `Round` 0 to 3 select the ASCII literals `"ROUND 1"` through `"ROUND 4"` at
 * 0x00102064, drawn straight through `limeDrawFONT` with no `GameText` lookup.
 * Every other string in this function is translated; these four are not. A
 * localisation gap in the original, and one a port can fix.
 *
 * ### `mk3_init`'s fourth argument is `AIOn`
 *
 * All three call sites here leave `AIOn` in r3 across the switch that chose
 * between them, and reading `GameInit_LoadABit` again shows the identical shape
 * -- r3 is loaded from `AIOn` at 0x0002d974 and never reassigned before any of
 * its three calls. [ROSTER.md](../../docs/ROSTER.md) recorded that argument as
 * a constant `1`; it is not.
 *
 * ### Types corrected here
 *
 * `ScorpionFade`, `ScorpionFadeAdd`, `ScorpionFlash`, `lightsOn`,
 * `RoundSummaryTime` and `FightMessageTimer` were all declared `long` in this
 * file. Every one is loaded with `vldr` and compared against a float literal.
 * They were declared by functions that only ever assign them zero, which
 * assigns the same bits either way -- the same trap that had seven other
 * declarations wrong before a call site settled them.

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------- DrawControls
 *
 * armv7 0x0001ca44, 1,844 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * The on-screen touch controls: a joystick and six buttons for player one, and
 * the same again for player two when the screen is shared. `DrawHUD` calls it
 * once a frame while the game is not paused.
 *
 * It does two jobs, and the first is not drawing. **It rebuilds `ButtonsPos`
 * and `ButtonsPosP2` from the settings every frame** before drawing anything,
 * copying six five-word records out of whichever layout table the current
 * settings select. `HandleTouches` reads those same two arrays to decide what
 * the player pressed, so the layout the player sees and the layout the game
 * tests against cannot drift apart -- they are rebuilt together, from the same
 * source, in the same frame.
 *
 * ### Which layout table
 *
 * `Settings[4]` is the button count and `Settings[5]` picks stock or custom:
 *
 *      Settings[5] == 0        Settings[5] != 0
 *      4  ButtonsPos4          4  CustomButtonsPos4
 *      5  ButtonsPos5          5  CustomButtonsPos5
 *      6  ButtonsPos6          6  CustomButtonsPos6
 *
 * and when `P2Controls` is set, both halves are overwritten again from the
 * split-screen tables -- `ButtonsPosP2_1` / `ButtonsPos6P2_1` for player one and
 * `ButtonsPosP2_2` / `ButtonsPos6P2_2` for player two, chosen by each player's
 * own button count. The copy is written as five passes over six records, one
 * word per pass, which is why the loop looks inside out.
 *
 * ### Three alpha levels, one of them a setting
 *
 * The function starts by copying three RGBA constants onto its own stack:
 *
 *      {1, 1, 1, 0.6}   the buttons
 *      {1, 1, 1, 0.3}   the joystick base
 *      {1, 1, 1, 1.0}   the joystick knob
 *
 * and then **overwrites the first two alphas**. `Settings[6]` selects 0.5, 0.75
 * or 1.0 for the buttons, and the joystick base gets exactly half of whatever
 * that came out as. The knob is always opaque. So the controls-opacity setting
 * moves two of the three and the knob stays put, which is what makes the stick
 * readable at the lowest setting.
 *
 * ### The joystick
 *
 * Single player:
 *
 *      JoystickStatePosX = (long)ButtonSize
 *      JoystickStatePosY = (long)(limeScreenHeight - ButtonSize)
 *      JSIZE             = ButtonSize
 *
 * Split screen shrinks the stick to two thirds and lifts it, and puts player
 * two's on the right half:
 *
 *      JSIZE  = ButtonSize * 2/3
 *      P1     = ( ButtonSize*2/3,  limeScreenHeight - ButtonSize*4/3 )
 *      P2     = ( ButtonSize*4/3 + limeScreenWidth/2 + 48,
 *                 limeScreenHeight - ButtonSize*2/3 )
 *
 * The arithmetic runs in **double** in the original -- 2/3 is a `double`
 * literal and the sums go through `vcvt.f64.f32` -- so a port that does it in
 * float will land a pixel off at some resolutions.
 *
 * The base is drawn at `2 * JSIZE` square centred on that point, and the knob
 * is offset by `JoyOffset[JoystickState]`:
 *
 *      0  (  0,   0)   centre       5  (  0,  56)   down
 *      1  (  0, -56)   up           6  (-39,  39)   down-left
 *      2  ( 39, -39)   up-right     7  (-56,   0)   left
 *      3  ( 56,   0)   right        8  (-39, -39)   up-left
 *      4  ( 39,  39)   down-right
 *
 * Nine entries: the centre and eight compass points on a circle of radius 56,
 * with 39 standing in for 56/sqrt(2). The knob offsets are **not** scaled by
 * `JSIZE` -- they are pixels, so a port that changes the stick size has to
 * scale this table itself.
 *
 * ### The buttons
 *
 * Six records of five words each -- x, y, size, atlas cell, button id -- and a
 * record whose id is -1 is skipped. The sprite is drawn centred:
 *
 *      x - size/2,  y - size/2,  size x size
 *
 * and the atlas cell picks the UV:
 *
 *      u = ((cell & 3) * 2 + (ButtonStates[id] ? 0 : 1)) * 0.125
 *      v = (cell / 4) * 0.25
 *
 * so the sheet is **eight columns by four rows**, and a button's pressed and
 * unpressed art are the two halves of one pair -- **pressed is the even
 * column**. That pairing is why `cell & 3` indexes in twos.
 *
 * Player two's half is the same loop over `ButtonsPosP2` and `ButtonStatesP2`,
 * and it only runs when `P2Controls` is set.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------ Task_GameDestroy
 *
 * armv7 0x00022c74, 1,500 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Tears the fight down and decides what the game does next. Most of it is a
 * flat list -- every texture deleted, every scene freed -- and the last forty
 * lines are the only part that thinks.
 *
 * ### The kode does not survive the fight
 *
 * `*theKode = -1` is the second thing it does, before a single texture is
 * freed. Whatever kode was entered on the VS screen is gone the moment the
 * fight ends; nothing carries it into the next one.
 *
 * ### The music is stopped only if the music is on
 *
 * `if (Settings[2]) limeStopTune();` — the volume setting doubles as an
 * enable, so with music off the call is skipped rather than made against a
 * silent mixer. `FadeMusicOut` is cleared either way.
 *
 * ### The layer free is gated by the level's own table
 *
 *      Level_Info[LevelSelect * 0xf4] + 0x74 + i    a char * a layer, i in 0..7
 *
 * and a layer is freed only when the first byte of its name is non-zero. So a
 * level with four background layers frees four, and the other four slots are
 * left alone rather than freed blind. That 0xf4 stride is **244**, which is
 * `LEVEL_INFO_STRIDE` — the compiler builds it here as `61 * 4` out of shifts,
 * a third independent sighting after `GetNextLevel` and the BGEXTENTS loader.
 *
 * ### Sixteen scenes, one shape
 *
 * Every scene handle is freed the same way and then zeroed:
 *
 *      if (h) { LIME_FreeMeshSetTextures(h->0x80); LIME_FreeScene(h); h = 0; }
 *
 * `BGSceneHandle`, `BGSceneHandle2`, `SZEffectScene`, `SwatEffectScene`,
 * `SmashThruScene`, `SKEffectScene`, `CyraxSelfDestructScene`, `XeroxScene`,
 * `BloodScene`, `PitDeathScene`, `RocksScene`, `TrainScene`, `TrainDie1Scene`,
 * `TrainDie2Scene`, `SLDie1Scene`, `SLDie2Scene` — the same list
 * [GAME-EVENTS.md](../../docs/GAME-EVENTS.md) named from the other end, where
 * they are played rather than freed.
 *
 * `MeshSet_FIGHT` and `Scene_FIGHT` are freed last and are the only two that
 * are not zeroed afterwards.
 *
 * ### Where the game goes next
 *
 *      GameMode == 1                NextTask = 2, and disableHeartbeat()
 *      GameMode == 4 and JustWon    NextTask = 5, and LevelSelect advances
 *                                   through GetNextLevel
 *      otherwise                    NextTask = 2
 *
 * and `CurrentTask = 8` on every path. Then, outside a network game, a level
 * chosen from the pause menu overrides all of it:
 *
 *      if (InGameLevelSelect != LevelSelect) {
 *          LevelSelect = InGameLevelSelect;
 *          NextTask    = 5;
 *      }
 *
 * so **the in-game level select wins over the survival ladder**. Picking a
 * stage mid-fight and then finishing the round sends you to that stage, not to
 * the next rung.
 *
 * `opponentCharacter = -1` is the last thing written, which is what makes the
 * next fight pick a fresh opponent rather than reuse this one's.

/* ----------------------------------------------------------- UpdateArcadeCode
 *
 * armv7 0x00021ee8, 1,516 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * The fight tick. Not the kode entry the name suggests -- "arcade code" is the
 * ported arcade *engine*, and this is what steps it. It calls `mk3_update`, and
 * then `AddNewGameEvents` to drain what the step produced.
 *
 * ### The arcade runs at 55.93 Hz, and this is where that lives
 *
 *      FrameCompensation += 0.9322 / limeFPSScaleFactor;
 *      while (FrameCompensation >= 1.0f) {
 *          ... one arcade tick ...
 *          FrameCompensation -= 1.0f;
 *      }
 *
 * **0.9322 arcade ticks per display frame** -- 55.93 a second at sixty, which
 * is the original cabinet's rate. The loop runs zero, one or two ticks in a
 * frame, so the engine is already decoupled from the display and a port does
 * not have to invent that. `SpeedNormal` changes only the constant:
 * **0.4661 when clear, exactly half**, which is the slow-motion mode. The
 * compiler duplicated the whole accumulate for the two constants, so the two
 * arms look like different code and are not.
 *
 * ### `ToggleDebug` freezes the engine and nothing else
 *
 *      if (!ToggleDebug) mk3_update(joy, GameObjects);
 *
 * Everything after it -- the events, the HUD animation, the positions, the
 * camera -- runs either way. So the debug freeze holds the fighters still while
 * the presentation layer keeps ticking, which is what makes it useful and what
 * a port has to reproduce if it keeps the toggle.
 *
 * ### One tick
 *
 *      the joystick pair            from the caller, or from the wire
 *      mk3_update                   unless ToggleDebug
 *      the parent's send            sendSpriteListPacket, FrameCount++
 *      AnimateBG
 *      AddNewGameEvents             drain what the step queued
 *      RunGameEvents
 *      LIME_UpdateEvents
 *      HUDANIM_Update
 *      ArcadePosTo3dPos x8          every object into its player slot
 *      Player1Pos / Player2Pos      out of Players +8 and +0x5f8
 *      RunJaxGrowCounters, and Jax's squash
 *      PlayerAutoSmoothAnims x2
 *      TrackCam
 *
 * The eight objects sit at `GameObjects[0] + i * 16` -- **a 16-byte stride**,
 * the same one `RenderLevelPlayers` walks -- and each lands at
 * `Players + i * 0x5f0 + 8`.
 *
 * ### The camera flattens during a finisher
 *
 * With `IsInFinishing` set and `DoingStageFatal` clear, both positions are
 * copied to the stack and **both get the lower of the two Z values** before
 * `TrackCam` sees them, so the camera does not tilt up when the winner is
 * airborne over a corpse. Any other time `TrackCam` gets them unmodified --
 * and on the network guest it gets them **swapped**, player two first, because
 * the guest is player two.
 *
 * ### Jax's squash
 *
 * Frames 0x1b12 to 0x1b2c on either object trigger it: the whole 0x5f0-byte
 * PLAYER is copied into `JaxSquashedPlayer`, `JaxGrowCounter` is zeroed,
 * `JaxBeingSquashed` is set, and the live player's mirror flag is **toggled
 * between 0 and 0x10** with the old value saved in `JaxSquashFlip`. The counter
 * then increments every tick, and `RenderLevelPlayers` stops drawing the
 * squashed copy once it passes 0x108.
 *
 * ### The network split
 *
 * `isParentBasedOnSpeed` decides which half a machine runs.
 *
 * **The parent** builds the joystick pair from its own stick and
 * `mpOpponentJoystickInput` -- two words an entry, the second being
 * `opponentFPS2` -- steps the engine, and sends the sprite list every tick.
 * The joystick packet goes out **only when the bits change**, compared against
 * `lastJoybits`, so an idle stick costs nothing on the wire.
 *
 * **The guest never steps the engine.** It drains every sprite list that has
 * arrived, in a loop:
 *
 *      while (setNextSpritesAndEvents()) {
 *          GameObjects[0] = &mpSpriteList[i * 160];
 *          Player1Pos, Player2Pos memcpy'd out of the packet
 *          MKEventQueue  memcpy'd out of the packet, 0x54 bytes
 *          the packet's event block memset to zero
 *          AnimateBG / AddNewGameEvents / RunGameEvents / LIME_UpdateEvents
 *      }
 *      if (!SpritelistReceived) GameObjects[0] = dummyObjects;
 *
 * so a guest that fell behind catches up by running every queued list in one
 * display frame rather than one a frame. And a guest that has never received

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ TrackCam
 *
 * armv7 0x0001b8b4, 1,840 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * The fight camera. A leaf function -- **not one call in 1,840 bytes**, just
 * float arithmetic over named tuning globals -- called once a tick from
 * `UpdateArcadeCode` with the two fighters' positions.
 *
 * There are **two cameras in here** and `NewCam` picks between them. The old
 * one is the PSP camera and it is dead code in the shipped build unless
 * `NewCam` is cleared; it is decompiled below because it is still reachable and
 * because it is the simpler of the two to read against.
 *
 * ### The screen edges are converted once, at the top
 *
 *      CamLeftLimit3d  = CamLeftLimit  / WorldScaleAdjust
 *      CamRightLimit3d = CamRightLimit / WorldScaleAdjust
 *
 * so the two limits are authored in arcade units and cached in world units
 * every frame. Both cameras clamp against the `3d` pair, never the originals.
 *
 * ### The old camera: a spring with a speed limit
 *
 *      t      = (|a.x - b.x| - 1) / psp_maxdist,  clamped to [0, 1]
 *      target = (t*a.x + midpoint*(1 - t)) * psp_scale + psp_off
 *      CamVelX = (target - Camera.x) * 0.125,  clamped to +-mxvelx
 *      Camera.x += CamVelX
 *
 * Far apart it follows **player one**; close together it slides to the
 * midpoint. The height is a straight lerp on distance:
 *
 *      u = (clamp(dist, distzoomedin, distzoomedout) - distzoomedin)
 *          / (distzoomedout - distzoomedin)
 *      Camera.y = -((1 - u)*camzoomedin + u*camzoomedout)
 *      Camera.z = camheight
 *
 * ### The new camera: distance sets the pull-back
 *
 *      dist = clamp(|(a.x - b.x) * 1.5| + 5.0, 6.0, 8.0)
 *
 * and the camera sits exactly that far behind the look-at in Y --
 * `NewCamera.y = a.y - dist`. So **the pull-back is a clamped linear function
 * of how far apart the fighters are**, and 6 to 8 is its whole range.
 *
 * The look-at tracks the midpoint but is leashed to player one:
 *
 *      DistInX = clamp(midpoint - a.x, -MaxDistInX, MaxDistInX)
 *      NewCameraLookAt.x = a.x + DistInX
 *
 * so a fighter who runs away drags the camera only `MaxDistInX` before the
 * other one starts leaving the frame. `swivelscale` is set to 1 and
 * `zoomedoutweight` to 0 on entry and neither is read again here.
 *
 * ### Z is optional, and clamped to two different windows
 *
 * The third argument gates the Z work entirely. With it set:
 *
 *      NewCameraLookAt.z = midZ + 1.25 - SceneGroundOffset,  clamped [1.25, 2.25]
 *      NewCamera.z       = midZ + 1.5  - SceneGroundOffset,  clamped [1.5,  2.5]
 *
 * Two windows a quarter apart, so the camera always looks slightly down.
 *
 * ### A stage fatality follows the falling player
 *
 * `DoingStageFatal` is `player + 1`, and its two values pick **which fighter's
 * Z the camera follows** -- 1 takes `a.z`, anything else takes `b.z`, and both
 * recompute the two Z values above from that one player rather than the
 * midpoint. That is the camera riding someone down the pit.
 *
 * ### Jax's grow drifts the look-at
 *
 *      NewCameraLookAt.x += min(JaxGrowCounter, 0xaf) * 0.0075 * 1.2
 *
 * negated when `JaxSquashFlip` is set, so the drift goes the way the squashed
 * fighter was facing. The counter is capped at 0xaf here while
 * `RenderLevelPlayers` stops drawing the squashed copy at 0x108 -- **the camera
 * stops moving before the sprite disappears**, which is presumably the point.
 *
 * ### Three ways the result is committed
 *
 *      LockCamera        nothing is written at all
 *      IsInFinishing     Camera and CameraLookAt EASE toward their targets at
 *                        0.125 a tick -- unless SnapCam, which jumps
 *      otherwise         both are assigned outright
 *
 * and `OverrideCamera` fires only inside the finisher path, where
 * `CamOverridePos.x` overwrites the X of both the camera and the look-at.
 * `SnapCam` is cleared on every exit, so it is a one-shot.
 *
 * The direct commit writes the look-at as `x + (y - x)` -- **an ease with the
 * weight gone**, which the compiler could not fold because it is float. It is
 * an assignment, and it is written as one below.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- IntroRender
 *
 * armv7 0x00025784, 1,484 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * The pre-fight intro: a two-shot camera move over the fighters, then a
 * cross-fade into the gameplay camera. Runs once a frame while `DoIntro` is
 * set, and takes itself down when it is done.
 *
 * ### Four keyframes, built from where the fighters actually stand
 *
 * The eye path and the look-at path are four `vec3` each, and their **X and Y
 * are rewritten every frame** from the two players:
 *
 *      IntroPos[0].x = P2.x - 1.25      IntroLook[0] = (P2.x, P2.y)
 *      IntroPos[1].x = P2.x + 0.25      IntroLook[1] = (P2.x, P2.y)
 *      IntroPos[2].x = P1.x + 1.25      IntroLook[2] = (P1.x, P1.y)
 *      IntroPos[3].x = P1.x - 0.25      IntroLook[3] = (P1.x, P1.y)
 *
 * so it is two shots -- 0 to 1 across player two, then 2 to 3 across player one
 * -- and each sweeps 1.5 units past its subject. Z is never written and stays
 * at its initialiser, 1.6 for every eye keyframe.
 *
 * `IntroCamCount` steps by **two**, so it is the shot index rather than the
 * keyframe index, and at 4 the camera work is over.
 *
 * ### The eye's height lerps from a value in the next array
 *
 * The lerp reads the *from* keyframe's Z at a **constant** offset, `IntroPos +
 * 0x50`. `IntroPos` is 0x30 bytes -- four `vec3` -- so 0x50 is thirty-two bytes
 * past its end, and lands inside `IntroLook` on keyframe 2's Z.
 *
 * It is not a harmless overrun. `IntroLook[2].z` is **1.35** in the data and
 * this function never writes any look-at Z, while every `IntroPos` Z is
 * **1.6**. So the eye rises from 1.35 to 1.6 across each shot instead of
 * holding 1.6. The drift is visible, it is what shipped, and a port that
 * "fixes" the index changes how the intro looks. Written below the way the
 * binary reads it.
 *
 * ### Three phases
 *
 *      IntroCamCount <= 2    animate the fighters a frame at a time, lerp the
 *                            camera between the shot's two keyframes
 *      IntroCamCount  > 2    TrackCam takes over and the intro camera
 *                            CROSS-FADES into it on the same timer
 *      IntroCountTimer >= 1  in phase three: pin the timer at 60, clear
 *                            DoIntro, call EndIntro
 *
 * The animation catch-up is the same accumulate the fight tick uses --
 * `IntroFrameComp += 1 / limeFPSScaleFactor` and a frame of animation per whole
 * unit -- so the intro plays at a fixed rate whatever the display does.
 *
 * **The timer is only advanced in phase three.** Phases one and two read it and
 * reset it to zero when it reaches 1.0, but nothing here increments it; that
 * happens inside `AnimateIntroCharacterPlayers1Frame`.
 *
 * ### Skipping it
 *
 * Outside a network game, a touch ends the intro immediately -- but the test is
 * inverted from what you would expect:
 *
 *      limeLastTouchScreenX == -1 && limeTouchScreenX != -1
 *
 * that is, **nothing was touched last frame and something is touched now**: the
 * leading edge of a tap, not the tap itself. `DoIntro` is cleared and `EndIntro`
 * runs. In a network game the intro cannot be skipped at all.
 *
 * ### The fade, and what viewing achievements does to it
 *
 * While `FE_FadeAdd` is non-zero the fade advances and the intro does nothing
 * else. The step normally divides by `limeFPSScaleFactor`; while the
 * achievements overlay is up it **multiplies** by it instead, and by a tenth:
 *
 *      normal          FE_Fade += FE_FadeAdd / limeFPSScaleFactor
 *      achievements    FE_Fade += FE_FadeAdd / 10 * limeFPSScaleFactor
 *
 * Two different senses of the same scale factor in one function. At either end
 * the fade clamps and clears `FE_FadeAdd`, so it is self-terminating.

/* --------------------------------------------------------------- Task_GameMain
 *
 * armv7 0x0002afec, 2,288 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * The fight's per-frame task. Everything else in this file is reached from
 * here: input, the arcade tick, the 3D pass, the HUD, the pause menu, the
 * stage-fatality cutaway and the fade that ends the round.
 *
 * ### The frame, in order
 *
 *      InGame = 1
 *      a stage picked from the pause menu starts a fade-out
 *      one hardware key can press BLOCK for both sides
 *      FrameCount and GameCounter step by 1 / limeFPSScaleFactor
 *      2D state: basic blend, colour mask RGB only, 2D, basic blend again
 *      the intro, if one is running -- and NOTHING ELSE this frame
 *      MaintainLevelScenes
 *      the round summary swallows input, or a transfer takes it instead
 *      GetReal6ButtonJoyBits for player one, and player two on a shared pad
 *      UpdateArcadeCode                          <- the fight itself
 *      DeviceRenderSettings, LightPlayers, RenderGameView
 *      the stage-fatality cutaway, if one is running
 *      DrawHUD
 *      karnage scoring
 *      the stage-fatal camera pull
 *      the fade, and the music fade riding on it
 *      the black overlay, ShowDebugInfo, UpdateInGamePauseMenu
 *
 * ### limePressed is one 64-bit mask, and bit 8 presses BLOCK for both sides
 *
 * The test the compiler emitted is
 *
 *      (limePressed[0] & 0x100) | (limePressed[1] & 0)
 *
 * and the second half is ANDed with zero, so it can never contribute. That is
 * exactly what a 64-bit `limePressed & 0x100` compiles to on a 32-bit target --
 * the high word's mask is all zeroes and the AND is emitted anyway. So
 * `limePressed` is a **single 64-bit key bitmask**, not two independent words.
 *
 * When the bit is set both joy words are pre-seeded with 0x400 *before*
 * `GetReal6ButtonJoyBits` runs, and that function ORs into whatever it finds
 * there. 0x400 is the bit it otherwise only sets on the **rising edge** of
 * `buttons[6]`, the special/block button -- so this key holds block down for
 * **both players at once** and skips the edge gate. No touch control reaches
 * it; it is a key path inherited from the Java ME build.
 *
 * ### The intro owns the whole frame
 *
 * While `DoIntro` is set the task runs `AnimateBG`, `LIME_UpdateEvents`,
 * `IntroRender`, both `LIME_RenderEvents` passes and `IntroRender2dBits`, and
 * then **returns** -- no input, no arcade tick, no HUD. It only falls through
 * on the frame `IntroRender` clears `DoIntro` itself. In a network game the
 * intro is cleared before any of that, so `GameMode == 1` never sees one.
 *
 * ### Three ways the frame gets its input
 *
 *      RoundSummary == 1     JoystickState = 0, and every button is moved to
 *                            LastButtonStates and cleared -- so the summary
 *                            sees releases and the fight sees nothing
 *      G->field44e != 0      ReadControls() instead, the transfer path that
 *                            `getTransferableFlags` reads from the other end
 *      otherwise             nothing extra
 *
 * and `GetReal6ButtonJoyBits` runs afterwards in **all three** cases. Player
 * two is only read when `P2Controls` is set, and then with `which = 1` and the
 * object pointer advanced by one 16-byte record.
 *
 * `UpdateArcadeCode` is skipped entirely while `GamePaused` or `LIME_Paused` is
 * set -- the render still runs, so a paused fight is a live picture of a frozen
 * world. With no second pad it is called with a **null** second joy word rather
 * than a pointer to the unused one.
 *
 * ### The stage fatality: a 330-tick cutaway on one float
 *
 * `DoSmokesEarthFatal` is a float counter, not the flag its declaration in this
 * file suggested, and every stage of the cutaway is a threshold on it:
 *
 *      <= 120     nothing drawn, the counter just runs
 *       > 120     the starfield tiles the screen, 512x512 at a time
 *       > 120     the earth, 128x128, centred
 *       > 240     ...and the earth shakes +-8 px, alternating on the tick's
 *                 parity, so it is a 1-tick square wave rather than a wobble
 *      >= 300     the earth is gone; the explosion animation and its sound
 *      300..330   a white flash over everything, 1.0 fading to 0 across 30
 *
 * The explosion is driven by the same counter at **two different rates**: the
 * frame index steps every 5 ticks and the scale grows every 7, from 2.0 by a
 * quarter each step, and drawing stops once the 7-tick index passes 15. The
 * frame index is passed unclamped -- `DrawAnimAsSprite` clamps it to the last
 * frame itself, which is why nothing bounds it here.
 *
 * The sound fires once, on the first frame past 300, and only if `Settings[3]`
 * is set -- the same "the volume setting doubles as an enable" shape
 * `Task_GameDestroy` uses for music. Its volume is `MusicVol[Settings[3]]`,
 * a table indexed by the setting rather than the setting scaled.
 *
 * ### Karnage refills the health bar every frame and banks the difference
 *
 *      KarnageScore += (100 - Health[1]) * 100
 *      Health[0] = Health[1] = 100, and the two bar widths with them
 *
 * so mode 3 is not a fight that can be lost: whatever damage landed this frame
 * becomes score at a hundred points a point, and both fighters are topped up
 * before the next one. The multiply is built out of shifts as `n * 20 * 5`.
 *
 * ### Where the fade sends the game
 *
 * The fade itself is the same self-terminating shape `IntroRender` uses, down
 * to the achievements overlay dividing by ten and multiplying by the scale
 * factor instead of dividing. What is new here is the end of it:
 *
 *      FE_Fade hits 0 going down, and DontQuitAfterFade is clear
 *          -> CurrentTask = 7, InGame = 0, GamePaused = 0, otherPlayerPaused = 0
 *
 * Task 7 is the fight's teardown. So **the fade is what ends the round** --
 * nothing else in this function leaves the task. `DontQuitAfterFade` is the
 * opt-out for fades that are only meant to dim the screen.
 *
 * Riding on the same fade, and only while `Settings[2]` and `FadeMusicOut` are
 * both set, `limeSetTuneVol(FE_Fade * 100)` walks the music down with the
 * picture, and `FadeMusicOut` clears itself when it lands on zero.

/* ----------------------------------------------------------- RenderLevelPlayers
 *
 * armv7 0x00023ee8, 4,572 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Where the game stops being arcade logic and becomes OpenGL. It walks the
 * engine's object list **twice** and, for each object, resolves an animation
 * frame, builds a model matrix and hands it to `RenderPlayer` or
 * `LIME_RenderScene`. [RENDER-PLAYERS.md](../../docs/RENDER-PLAYERS.md) is the
 * map that was made of it before it was written; this is the transcription.
 *
 * ### The two passes, and the walk that is not a plain walk
 *
 * `mk3_who_in_front()` decides the order. Its complement is `startOneIn`, and
 * when that is set the walk visits the list as **1, 0, 2, 3, ...**: it starts
 * at `GameObjects->next`, comes back to the head after the first object, and
 * then steps **twice** to skip the one it already drew. When it is clear the
 * walk is the plain 0, 1, 2, ... one.
 *
 * `limeClearDepthBuffer()` runs on pass 0 **after the first object only**, and
 * sets `ClearedZBuffer`. That is what lets the far fighter be drawn, the depth
 * buffer wiped, and the near fighter drawn over it without sorting.
 *
 * ### The reset covers nine slots, the sweep only eight
 *
 * Before the walk, `p->f584 = 100.0f` for **nine** PLAYER records. After both
 * passes, `if (p->f584 == 100.0f) p->f5ec = -1` for **eight**. The ninth slot
 * is marked and never swept, so its `f5ec` keeps whatever the previous frame
 * left there. Both counts are built from the same 0x5f0 stride in the binary
 * (0x3570 is nine of them, 0x2f80 is eight), so this is the original's
 * off-by-one and not a reading of it.
 *
 * ### One object, in order
 *
 *      LastGObj = obj                        the walk's cursor, published
 *      side = obj->f0d & 1                   which fighter owns it
 *      slot = (int8)obj->f0d >> 1            which PLAYER record it draws into
 *      chr  = (int8)obj->f0c                 which character it looks like
 *
 * Slots 0 and 1 are the fighters; 2 and up are projectiles, and the debug
 * `printf` calls in here name them exactly that ("projectile@%d").
 *
 * ### Same character on both sides: the owner is swapped, not the model
 *
 * When both fighters picked the same character one of them has to draw from
 * the *other* record, or they would share one animation state. The test is
 *
 *      GameObjects[1].chr == GameObjects[0].chr
 *      && GameObjects[1].chr != Players[0].anim->f08
 *
 * and it fires for slot 0 and for every projectile owned by side 0. The
 * override is applied around the draw and **taken back off afterwards** --
 * `P->anim` is saved, replaced with `Players[1].anim`, drawn, restored. The
 * owner pointer is repointed too, at `GameObjects[1]`'s side rather than this
 * object's.
 *
 * ### The frame id decides almost everything
 *
 *      0x4e20            no model: skip the transform, park f584 at 100
 *      0x1b36, 0x1b37    clear the mirror bit
 *      0x1b4e .. 0x1b67  TOGGLE the mirror bit
 *      0x10aa            set SkipFrame86 for the duration of one RenderScene
 *      0x1a7e .. 0x1a80  a spear, and 0x129c .. 0x129e another three
 *      0x758             starts the stage fatality: DoSmokesEarthFatal = 0.01
 *
 * That last one is the other end of `Task_GameMain`'s cutaway: one animation
 * frame kicks the 330-tick counter off its zero, and every threshold in that
 * function follows from here.
 *
 * The spear ids write `SpearWhichTexture[which] = 1..5` in id order and take
 * `which` from **flags bit 7**, not from the slot. `SpearStartPos[which]` is
 * copied from `Players[which]`'s 3D position and `SpearEndPos[which]` from the
 * object's -- so the spear is a line from a fighter to the object.
 * `DrawSpear[which] = 1` is the fallback when no id matched, which is the
 * common case; the five ids pick a texture, everything else draws the default.
 *
 * ### Character 24's mirror is inverted
 *
 *      P->f540 = obj->flags & 0x10
 *      if (P->chr == 24) { if (P->f540) P->f540 = 1; P->f540 ^= 1; }
 *
 * Whatever bit the object carries, character 24 draws the other way round.
 * `RenderIntroCharacterPlayer` already recorded that this character is the only
 * one with a hardcoded mirror; this is the same fact from the gameplay side.
 *
 * ### The transform, twice
 *
 * The same six GL calls are emitted in two places -- once for the pass-0 model
 * matrix and once for every projectile -- and the only difference is where the
 * result is read back to, `f588` the first time and `f548` the second:
 *
 *      glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW); glLoadIdentity();
 *      glTranslatef(P->x, P->y, P->z);
 *      glScalef(s, s, s);                  s = PlayerDefs[chr].f04 * PlayerSize
 *      glTranslatef(PlayerDefs[chr].f10 * ±2.15, 0, PlayerDefs[chr].f14 * 0.65);
 *      glRotatef(90, 1, 0, 0);
 *      if (mirrored) glScalef(-1, 1, 1);
 *
 * `+2.15` mirrored, `-2.15` not. The `glScalef(-1,1,1)` is the mirror proper,
 * and the cull face is flipped to match further down -- `GL_FRONT` when
 * mirrored, `GL_BACK` otherwise, the fifth sighting of that pairing in this
 * tree. Alongside the GL matrix a `limeMATRIX` is built for the same object:
 * `limeScaleMatrixXYZ(m, ±s, s, s)` with the translation written straight into
 * the fourth row, then `limeMatrixMult(M_Rot90, m, &P->f548)`. `M_Rot90` is set
 * up once at the top with **1.57075**, which is not pi/2.
 *
 * ### Slot 3 gets a debug print, every frame, forever
 *
 *      if (slot == 3) LIME_printf(4, "**ph arcadeXY=%f,%f,%f, otype %d\n", ...)
 *
 * No flag guards it. `LIME_printf` is an eight-byte no-op in this build, so it
 * costs three float-to-double conversions and a call -- but it is a live debug
 * print that shipped.
 *
 * ### The debug arm swallows the fighter
 *
 * `axes` is set whenever `LIME_Paused` is on, and whenever the frame lookup
 * fails (`P->f14 == -1`) -- the four `LIME_printf` variants in here are that
 * failure being reported, two for a projectile and two for a fighter. When it
 * is set the object goes down a different path: `ArcadePosTo3dPosNO_OFFSETS`
 * and `RenderAxesLines`, then `RenderPlayer(P, 0, 0)` instead of
 * `RenderPlayer(P, 0, 1)`; and when the lookup failed as well, `RenderPlayer`
 * is not called at all.
 *
 * `RenderAxesLines` is an empty function in the retail binary and
 * `RenderDebugCube` only loads a scene behind a debug flag, so on a shipped
 * device this arm draws **nothing** and the object silently vanishes. It is
 * still the arm a paused game takes.
 *
 * ### Events fire on pass 1 only, and only when the frame changed
 *
 *      P->f5e8 = P->f14 (or f51c for a fighter)
 *      if (P->f5e8 != P->f5ec) { trigger; P->f5ec = P->f5e8; followMode = 1; }
 *
 * so a scene's events fire once per frame *change*, not once per rendered
 * frame. Projectiles go through `LIME_TriggerEventsFromScene`; fighters go
 * through `LIME_TriggerEventsFromSceneOffsetIfFollowing` with **eleven**
 * arguments and three variants, chosen by the frame id:
 *
 *      0x1b12 .. 0x1b2c   the scene is P->anim's and the skin comes from the
 *                         OTHER fighter, Players[slot ^ 1].f528
 *      an override live    the scene is the override's
 *      otherwise           the scene is P->anim's
 *
 * and its last argument is 1 exactly for frames 0x1b4e..0x1b67 -- the same
 * range that toggles the mirror bit, tested a second time here.
 *
 * `AxeTrailDisallowed` is a countdown that suppresses the trigger entirely for
 * character 3, and decrements once per frame while it does.
 *
 * ### f584 is borrowed as a scratch flag
 *
 * `f584` starts at 100.0 for every slot. A fighter whose events are about to
 * fire has it set to 1.0 for the duration of the trigger and put back to 100.0
 * afterwards; an object with frame 0x4e20 parks it at 100.0 and never moves it.
 * So the sweep at the end reads three different things through one float: a
 * sentinel, a re-entrancy guard, and "did this slot draw".

/* ------------------------------------------------------ UpdateInGamePauseMenu
 *
 * armv7 0x00026c84, 5,720 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * The pause menu, drawn and driven from inside `Task_GameMain`. `GamePaused`
 * is a three-state variable, not a flag, and it selects which of three screens
 * this function is:
 *
 *      0   not paused          -> TogglePauseMenu() and nothing else
 *      1   the menu            -> six touch options
 *      2   the moves list      -> MovesList() under a CANCEL button
 *
 * ### Six options, all at the same x, 56 apart
 *
 *      y=6    GameText(0xf9)   the heading, and option 1 -- RESUME
 *      y=62   GameText(9)      EXIT (asks first)
 *      y=118  "%s : %s"        control layout, from Settings[4]
 *      y=174  "%s : %s"        the second layout line, from Settings[5]
 *      y=230  "%s : %s"        MUSIC, from Settings[2]
 *      y=286  "%s : %s"        SFX,   from Settings[3]
 *
 * all at x=384, scale 1.25, wrapped at `FE_W(186)`. **The heading is a live
 * button** -- `GameText(0xf9)` is drawn with `DrawOptionAsButton` like the
 * rest, so tapping the title resumes the game.
 *
 * ### Every option fires on RELEASE, and only on a real release
 *
 *      LastTouch_PauseN = Touch_PauseN;
 *      Touch_PauseN     = DrawOptionAsButton(...);
 *      if (LastTouch_PauseN && !Touch_PauseN && limeTouchScreenX[0] == -1.0f)
 *
 * -- the finger has to have been inside last frame, be outside now, **and** be
 * off the screen entirely. Sliding off an option does not activate it. The
 * highlight colour is `mmfontcol[(LastTouch + 1) * 4]`, so it lags the touch by
 * a frame.
 *
 * ### The selection is carried in one variable that starts as GameMode
 *
 * `sl` holds `GameMode` while the network check runs, is then overwritten with
 * 0 and set to 1..5 by whichever option was released. Option 6 does not set it
 * -- it branches straight into its own handler -- which leaves the `sl == 6`
 * test in the dispatcher **unreachable**. Transcribed as written.
 *
 * ### The click is played before the action, and only for options 1 to 5
 *
 *      if (Settings[3]) limePlaySound(SFXHandle[0x68/4],
 *                                     MusicVol[Settings[3]] / 100, 1.0f, 0);
 *
 * `Settings[3]` is the SFX setting and doubles as the enable, the same shape
 * `Task_GameDestroy` uses for music. Option 6 -- the SFX option itself --
 * bypasses this and plays its click *after* changing the setting, so turning
 * SFX on clicks and turning it off does not.
 *
 * ### What each option does
 *
 *      1  RESUME     GamePaused = 0, and three sendPause(0) on the network
 *      2  EXIT       clears four flags, QuitAsLose(), then FIVE analytics
 *                    events -- one for the menu and one per game mode
 *      3  BUTTONS    Settings[4]++, wrapping 7 back to 5, then
 *                    mk3_set_four_button for both sides
 *      4  LAYOUT     GameMode 6: Player2NumButtons++, wrapping 7 to 5
 *                    otherwise:  Settings[5] ^= 1
 *      5  MUSIC      a four-state cycle; see below
 *      6  SFX        Settings[3] = (Settings[3] + 1) & 3
 *
 * Options 3, 4 and 6 call `Write_SettingsData()`; option 5 calls it only on the
 * branch that does not find user music. **Turning the music off because the
 * device is playing its own does not persist** -- `limeCheckForUserMusic()`
 * sets `Settings[2] = 0` and returns without saving.
 *
 * ### The music option changes the volume for the state it is leaving
 *
 *      Settings[2] == 3   limeStopTune()
 *      Settings[2] == 0   limePlayTune(LevelMusic[LevelSelect], MusicVol[1], 1)
 *      Settings[2] == 1   limeSetTuneVol(MusicVol[2])
 *      Settings[2] == 2   limeSetTuneVol(MusicVol[3])
 *      then Settings[2] = (Settings[2] + 1) & 3
 *
 * so the volume applied is `MusicVol[Settings[2] + 1]` -- the level it is about
 * to move to, applied before the move. The compiler wrote this as a fall-
 * through cascade that re-reads `Settings[2]` after each arm; since none of the
 * calls touch it, exactly one arm runs.
 *
 * ### The moves list is dismissed by a corner, not a button
 *
 * With `GamePaused == 2` the CANCEL sprite is drawn at the top right, scaled by
 * `HUD_Scale`, and the dismiss test is a raw rectangle rather than a hit-tested
 * option:
 *
 *      last touch x > limeScreenWidth - HUD_Scale * 80
 *      last touch y < HUD_Scale * 80
 *
 * on the frame the finger comes off. The sprite is 36 units square and the hit
 * box is 80 -- more than twice the drawn size in each direction.
 *
 * ### The network game has two extra screens
 *
 * When `GameMode == 1` and `otherPlayerPaused` is set the local player gets a
 * cut-down panel: `GameText(0x3bb)` as a label and `GameText(9)` as the only
 * option, which arms `PauseMenuAreYouSure`. The confirm itself --
 * `GameText(0x11b)` over `GameText(0xeb)`/`GameText(0xec)` -- appears in
 * **four** places in the binary, once per (paused state x network) combination,
 * each with its own copy of the "INGAME PAUSE MENU"/"EXIT" strings. They are
 * written out here the same way, because the four are not quite identical: the
 * two network copies call `QuitAsLose()` directly on confirm, and the two local
 * ones set the selection and let the dispatcher do it.
