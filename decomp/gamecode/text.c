 * **Type 4 is the eight-byte one, not type 3** -- the table is not in address
 * order and reading it as though it were swaps the two.
 *
 * **Case 4 is the double, and this is the marshaller that proves it.** A double
 * arrives as a REGISTER PAIR under this binary soft-float ABI -- the fact the
 * runtime already depends on -- and here it is again from the other side: eight
 * bytes read, eight bytes stepped, two words stored. `getToken` closes the
 * loop: the token character that produces type 4 is `f`.
 *

 * `strh r3, [r5, #4]`, not `str`. So a type-3 token reuses whatever the upper
 * 16 bits of that slot held from a previous call. It still steps the cursor by
 * a full 4, because the value was promoted to int on the way in.
 *
 * An unknown tag is not fatal: it prints
 *
 *      USPRINTF ERROR - WRONG ORDER OF ARGUMENTS! TOKEN = %d
 *
 * and carries on to the next token with the cursor NOT advanced -- which
 * desynchronises everything after it. The message says "wrong order" because
 * that is how it happens in practice: the tokens are parsed from the format

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------- usprintf
 *
 * armv7 0x000a7754, 176 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * The UTF-16 printf. Two passes over the format string with the marshaller
 * between them:
 *
 *      n = processString(dst, fmt, len, 1, &varargs)    <- pass 1, collects
 *      initArguments(n, &varargs)                       <- pulls the values
 *      processString(dst, fmt, len, 0, &varargs)        <- pass 2, emits
 *
 * **The token count comes out of pass one and goes straight into
 * initArguments** -- that is the `count` argument whose loop bound was
 * otherwise unexplained. The three functions getToken, initArguments and
 * processString are all halves of this one.
 *
 * Sixteen token slots, cleared two words at a time before pass one: the type
 * and the value, not `value2`. So a slot whose previous use was a double keeps
 * the high half of it.
 *
 * ### The semaphore that cannot clear
 *
 * On entry, while `g_usprintfSemaphore` is non-zero it prints
 *
 *      \n<<< Waiting for g_usprintfSemaphore! >>>
 *
 * and re-reads it, forever. Nothing in this function releases it and there is
 * no yield in the loop, so on a single thread this is a hang that spams the
 * console rather than a wait. It only ever means something if usprintf can be
 * re-entered -- from an interrupt, or from a second thread -- and it is
 * transcribed as the spin it is.
 *
 * Returns 0 always.

/* --------------------------------------------------------------- LoadTextData
 *
 * armv7 0x000a7804, 216 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Loads the language string table. The file is a small header followed by
 * length-prefixed UTF-16 strings:
 *
 *      +0  int16   header size, SUBTRACTED from the file size to get the payload
 *      +6  int16   how many strings
 *      +8          each string: uint16 byte-length, then that many bytes
 *
 * Two allocations, both tagged: `"languagedata"` for the payload and
 * `"languagetextptrs"` for `count` pointers. Then
 *
 *      printf("Num Text strings Loading: %d\n", count)
 *
 * **Every string is rewritten with a UTF-16LE BOM in front of it.** The
 * destination cursor advances by `2 + len` while the source advances by
 * `2 + len` as well -- two bytes of length prefix in, two bytes of BOM out --
 * so the two stay in step by coincidence of the same number, not by design.
 * A zero-length string still gets its BOM and still costs two bytes.
 *
 * That is the third place the FF FE prefix appears: limeUC writes it, getToken
 * skips it, and this loader bakes it into every string the game ships. Anything
 * reading `LanguageTextPtrs[i]` gets a pointer AT the BOM, not past it.
 *
 * The size of the payload allocation is `fileSize - header[0]`, which is the
 * file minus its own header field -- not minus the eight bytes actually
 * consumed before the first string. The two differ unless header[0] is 8, and
 * nothing here says it is.
 *
 * The raw file is freed at the end; the payload it was copied into is not.
