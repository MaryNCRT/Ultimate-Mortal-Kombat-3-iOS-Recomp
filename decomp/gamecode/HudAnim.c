 *
 * ### The camera is three literal vectors
 *
 *      eye    (0, -5, 0)        __ZZ14HUDANIM_RendervE4C.11
 *      target (0,  0, 0)        __ZZ14HUDANIM_RendervE4C.10
 *      up     (0,  0, 1)        __ZZ14HUDANIM_RendervE4C.12
 *
 * Five units back along -Y, looking at the origin, Z up. That is a complete,
 * self-contained camera for the overlay and it does not depend on the game
 * camera at all -- **the orientation is set before the early-outs**, so even a
 * frame that draws nothing still moves the camera.
 *
 * ### It answers who writes SceneRenderAlwaysTrans
 *
 *      SceneRenderAlwaysTrans = 1
 *      LIME_RenderSceneOverrideTextures(*Scene_FIGHT, HSceneTextures, timer)
 *      SceneRenderAlwaysTrans = 0
 *
 * That flag was an open question in decomp/lime/RenderScene.c -- the renderer
 * reads it and nothing found so far set it. **This is the writer**, and it is
 * the only kind of writer that matters: it raises the flag for one draw call
 * and lowers it immediately. So "always transparent" is not a mode the game
 * sits in; it is a property of the HUD overlay scene and nothing else.
 *
 * The animation timer is converted from its float to an int right at the call
 * (`vcvt.s32.f32`), which is the frame index into the FIGHT scene.
 *
 * ### An uninitialised register on an unknown animation
 *
 * The mesh is chosen by `TheHud.anim`: 1 FIGHT, 2 FINISH-HIM, 3 FINISH-HER.
 * Zero returns early. **Any other value falls through to the draw with the mesh
 * register never written** -- the compiler emitted no default. It cannot happen
 * as long as only HUDANIM_TriggerAnim writes the field, which is why it does
 * not crash; it is still worth a bounds check in a port rather than a faithful
 * copy of the omission.
 *
 * Depth test and depth writes are both off for the overlay and both restored.
 * The 90-degree X rotation stands the flat sign up to face the camera.
