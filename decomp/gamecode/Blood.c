 *
 * armv7 0x000730c4, 484 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Runs the sixteen-slot event pool once a frame. A slot with `active == 0` or a
 * negative type is skipped; a type above 12 is skipped unless it is exactly 13.
 *
 * ### Types 0..12: blood, and which colour depends on the MODEL
 *
 * The position comes from `ArcadePosTo3dPos(obj, &event[0x0c], NULL)` and the
 * direction from `obj->flags & 0x10` -- **+1 or -1**, the same flag bit that
 * chooses the sign of the X offset in that conversion.
 *
 * The colour is chosen from the fighter's model id, read through
 * `PLAYER1MODEL` or `PLAYER2MODEL` depending on a signed byte at `obj + 0xd`:
 *
 *      model 7, 8 or 14   ->  DoBlackBlood
 *      model 11 or 19     ->  DoGreenBlood
 *      anything else      ->  DoBlood
 *
 * Those five ids are the robots and the reptilian characters, and they are
 * hardcoded here rather than carried in the player definition. The `7` and `8`
 * arrive as a range test (`(unsigned)(model - 7) <= 1`), which is the compiler
 * folding two comparisons, not a range in the data.
 *
 * All three are called with `z + 1.5f` -- the spray starts above the hit.
 *
 * **`Settings[0]` gates the blood entirely.** With it clear the event still
 * ages and still expires; nothing is drawn. So a port must not skip the
 * decrement along with the drawing.
 *
 * The hit sound is `get_tsound(0x22)` at `MusicVol[Settings[3]] / 100.0f`, and
 * only when `Settings[3]` is non-zero -- the same volume-index-into-a-float-
 * table that `PlayFatalityVoice` uses.
 *
 * ### Type 7 nudges the position first
 *
 *      x -= 0.765625f
 *      z -= 1.59375f
 *
 * then falls into the ordinary blood path. Two odd literals, both exact in
 * binary (49/64 and 51/32), so they were typed as decimals that happen to be
 * representable rather than tuned by ear.
 *
 * ### Type 13 is the screen shake
 *
 * A three-frame oscillator:
 *
 *      if (++event[0x2c] == 3) {
 *          event[0x2c] = 0;
 *          event[0x28]--;              <- shakes remaining
 *          event[0x24] = -event[0x24]; <- flip the offset
 *      }
 *      if (shakes remaining == 0) { CalcShakeOffset(0); event->active = 0; }
 *      else { CalcShakeOffset(event[0x24]); if (Settings[1]) limeSetVibrate(); }
 *
 * **The magnitude is negated, not recomputed**, so the shake alternates around
 * zero at exactly one third of the frame rate and ends by calling
 * `CalcShakeOffset(0)` -- it always leaves the camera centred rather than
 * wherever the last flip put it.
 *
 * `Settings[1]` is the vibration toggle, and it is checked per shake frame
 * rather than once.
 *
 * ### Expiry
 *
 * Every non-shake type decrements `event[0x24]` and frees the slot when it goes
 * **below** zero -- so a lifetime of 0 still runs one more frame.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------ AddNewGameEvents
 *
 * armv7 0x000732a8, 6,644 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * **The seam between the ported arcade logic and the iOS presentation layer.**
 * The MK3 fight engine does not draw, play sound, or know what a fatality is.
 * It appends eight-byte records to `MKEventQueue`, and once a frame this
 * function drains that queue and turns each record into blood, an FBX effect, a
 * sound, a banner, an achievement, a stat, or a change of round state.
 *
 * A port that wants to change how the game *looks* changes this function. A
 * port that wants to change how it *plays* does not touch it.
 *
 * Note there are two unrelated event queues in this file. `GameEvents` (stride
 * 0x64, above) is this file's own particle and screen-shake pool, run by
 * `RunGameEvents`. `MKEventQueue` is the engine's, and is what this function
 * reads -- though type 0 and the shake are how the one feeds the other.
 *
 * ### The record
 *
 *      +0  int8   type       0..4, the class
 *      +1  int8   player     which side the event is about
 *      +2  int8   subtype    the event proper
 *      +3  int8   (unused)
 *      +4  int32  param
 *
 * `MKEventQueue[0]` is the count and the records start at +4. The loop walks
 * exactly `count` of them and never looks at a used-flag, so the engine hands
 * over a fresh, packed array each frame.
 *
 * Eighty-eight switch arms across four tables; **thirty-nine do nothing**. The
 * 69-entry table for type 4 is an inline `.word` array the compiler jumps into
 * with `mov pc, r0`, so the dead subtypes are visible as explicit jumps back to
 * the loop tail rather than as gaps.
 *
 * ### Type 0 and the shake write GAMEEVENTs, which names three of its fields
 *
 * Type 0 calls `GetNewEvent`, stores the fighter's object at **+8** and drops
 * the 3D position at **+0xc**; `RunGameEvents` reads exactly those two. The
 * shake (type 1's default arm) takes event id 13 and writes **+0x24**, **+0x28**
 * and **+0x2c** -- magnitude, count and tick -- which is again exactly what
 * `RunGameEvents`'s `w[1] == 13` arm reads. Two functions written from opposite
 * ends of the same struct, agreeing field for field.
 *
 * ### The finishers, named by the binary
 *
 * Four of the five log an EA analytics event whose last argument is a plain
 * ASCII literal, so these names are **read, not inferred**:
 *
 *      22  Fatality     "Fatality"      (no music change)
 *      28  Animality    "Animality"     Animality.mp3
 *      29  Mercy        not logged      Mercy.mp3
 *      42  Friendship   "Friendship"    Friendship.mp3
 *      43  Babality     "Babality"      Babality.mp3
 *
 * Every logging call is `EASDK_LogEventEnumEnumString(0x3f7, 15,
 * DestinyNames[Destiny], 15, <name>)` -- the difficulty and the finisher. The
 * log fires only when the loser is actually at zero health; in `GameMode == 0`
 * it also unlocks an achievement and bumps a stat, which is why those two only
 * ever count arcade play; and in `GameMode == 1` the stat is bumped for
 * whichever side the local machine is, decided by `isParent()`.
 *
 * ### Stats and achievements this function owns
 *
 *      Stats[5]    fatalities        achievement 0xc on the first
 *      Stats[7]    friendships       achievement 0xb on the first
 *      Stats[8]    animalities       achievement 0xa on the first
 *      --          babalities        achievement 9 on the first
 *      --          the blast         achievement 4, outside modes 1 and 6
 *      --          a mercy then a finisher   achievement 5
 *
 * ### Two character indices appear as bare numbers
 *
 * `0x19` (Shao Kahn) gates the whole Shao-Kahn death sequence, and `0x15`
 * (classic Sub-Zero) **suppresses the friendship** on either side. Both match
 * [ROSTER.md](../../docs/ROSTER.md).
 *
 * ### `groundoffsets`
 *
 * Subtype 54 computes `blast_player_height = 0xf7 - groundoffsets[model]` -- a
 * per-character ground offset table at 0x001725bc subtracted from a fixed 247,
 * reading player 1's entry or player 2's depending on which side blasted. First
 * use of that table found, and what names it.
 *
 * ### The stage deaths pick their scene from the stage
 *
 * Subtype 58 is the stage death and it branches on `LevelSelect`:
 *
 *      4   Subway            TrainScene, then TrainDie1Scene or TrainDie2Scene
 *      11  Scorpion's Lair   SLDie1Scene or SLDie2Scene
 *
 * and nothing else. Those are exactly the two stages
 * [ROSTER.md](../../docs/ROSTER.md) found per-character deaths for, reached
 * from a different direction.
 *
 * ### Health arrives as a bar length
 *
 *      Health[p] = 100 * (param + 1) / 166
 *
 * the exact inverse of the `* 166 / 100` `GameCode.c` uses to draw the bar. The
 * run meter is `100 * param / 48`. Neither is a percentage on the wire.
 *
 * ### Two shared tails
 *
 * The sound tail (0x0007417e) is `limePlaySound(id, MusicVol[Settings[3]] /
 * 100.0f, 1.0f, 0)` and is skipped whole when `Settings[3]` is zero. The effect
 * spawn is *not* shared as tidily as it looks: every arm builds the matrix the
 * same way -- identity, `RotMatrixX(m, pi/2)`, `limeScaleMatrix(m, 1 /
 * WorldScaleAdjust)` -- and then they differ in what they put at `m[0x30]` and
 * `m[0x38]`, in whether a second scale follows, and in the 2.2 and 2.8 offsets
 * some of them add. Those differences are written out per arm below rather than
 * folded, because folding them is where a reading of this function would go
 * wrong.
 *
 * ### One dead store, and one uninitialised read that does not matter
 *
 * Subtype 13 stores `ev->player` back over itself, predicated on the combo
 * damage exceeding 100. It is a genuine no-op in the shipped code.
 *
 * Type 1 subtype 1 calls `SetCameraOverridePosFrom2d` with two stack words the
 * function never writes. That is safe only because the callee ignores both --
 * which `SetCameraOverridePosFrom2d` was already decompiled as doing, before
 * this call site was read.
