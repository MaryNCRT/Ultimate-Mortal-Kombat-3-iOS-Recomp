/* -------------------------------------------------------------- DoSmokesSmoke
 *
 * armv7 0x0005aff0, 624 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Emits Smoke's trail particles. Called with both fighters' ids and does the
 * same work twice, once per player.
 *
 * **The two characters that smoke are 22 and 14.** Both ids are hardcoded, and
 * they behave differently:
 *
 *      id == 22   the X offset is `SmokeAdjust`, or `SmokeAdjust2` when the
 *                 player's flag at +0x540 (player 1) / +0xb30 (player 2) is set
 *      id == 14   the X offset is 0.0
 *
 * So one of them is nudged sideways by a tunable and the other is not, and
 * which tunable depends on a per-player flag. `_SmokeAdjust2` is the same
 * global whose neighbourhood several format strings live in.
 *
 * Note +0xb30 is +0x540 plus 0x5f0 -- the player stride, confirmed again.
 *
 * ### The frame guard, and the intro exception
 *
 * Normally it reads a frame id out of `GameObjects` -- **+0x08 for player one
 * and +0x18 for player two**, both `int16` -- and emits nothing when that id is
 * 20000 or 6830. 20000 is the same `ARCADE_POS_RAW` sentinel
 * `ArcadePosTo3dPos` special-cases; 6830 is not otherwise known here.
 *
 * **While `DoIntro` is set the guard is skipped entirely** and the position is
 * taken straight from `Player1Pos` / `Player2Pos`. So smoke keeps coming during
 * the intro regardless of what frame the fighter is on.
 *
 * ### The puff height is randomised in double precision
 *
 *      z = pos[2] + 1.4 + (limeRand() & 15) / 15.0 * -0.7
 *
 * -- so it lands somewhere in a 0.7-unit band, from `z + 1.4` down to
 * `z + 0.7`, in sixteen steps. The whole expression is `.f64`: the add, the
 * divide by 15 and the `vmla`, narrowed to float only at the call. Sixteen
 * discrete heights, not a continuous range.
 *
 * `AddParticles(8, x, y, z, 60.0f, -1)` -- type 8, the same 60.0f speed the
 * blood functions use, and -1 where they pass a count.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------- AddParticles
 *
 * armv7 0x0005ab6c, 1,156 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Takes the first free slot in the 512-entry pool and fills it in. Four
 * different sets of initial velocities depending on the type, and they are
 * different enough that a port cannot collapse them.
 *
 * ### Finding a slot
 *
 * `field08` is the free marker -- it is the one word `InitParticles` clears,
 * and this function scans for the first slot whose `field08` is **exactly
 * 0.0f**. The scan runs indices 0 to 511 and **gives up silently** if all are
 * busy: no counter, no log, the particle is simply not emitted. With
 * `DoBlood` calling this eighty times a burst that matters, and it is the
 * behaviour to reproduce rather than fix.
 *
 * `type == 1` returns before the scan even starts. Nothing in the decompiled
 * code passes 1.
 *
 * ### What every type gets
 *
 *      field0c = type
 *      field10 = x                       passed straight through
 *      field14 = y + blood_zoff
 *      field18 = z + blood_yoff
 *      field20 = 0
 *      field04 = field08 = speed * 1.8f
 *
 * so the y and z the caller passes are **offsets from two globals**, not world
 * coordinates. `blood_zoff` lands on the y field and `blood_yoff` on the z --
 * that crossing is in the original and is what the names have to live with.
 *
 * Types 2, 4, 6 and 8 then overwrite `field04`/`field08` with a life instead:
 *
 *      max(0, (int)(speed - (limeRand() & 0xf)))
 *
 * clamped at zero with `bic r0, r0, r0, asr #31`, so a slow enough particle is
 * born already dead. Those four also set a size:
 *
 *      field00 = ((limeRand() & 3) + 1) * PSize * 0.25f
 *
 * four discrete sizes, a quarter of `PSize` apart.
 *
 * ### The four velocity sets
 *
 * All four draw three times from `PI_limeRand` -- the particle system's own
 * generator, not `limeRand` -- and mask to five bits.
 *
 * **Blood (2, 4, 6)** is the only one with a real Y velocity, and the only one
 * that scales by the `PScale` triple:
 *
 *      vx = (r/31.0 - 0.5)      * PScale[0]
 *      vy = (r/-31.0 * 0.5)     * PScale[1]
 *      vz = (r/31.0  * 0.5)     * PScale[2]
 *
 * **Type 0** aims the particle sideways from the fighter, and is the only place
 * the sixth argument is used at all:
 *
 *      vx = (r/32.0 - 0.5) * blood_xvs + (float)arg * blood_lrscale
 *      vx += blood_minxvel   if vx >= 0, otherwise vx -= blood_minxvel
 *      vx *= 0.01
 *      vy *= 0.0
 *      vz *= 0.1
 *
 * so `arg` is a **left/right bias** and `blood_minxvel` a floor that pushes the
 * particle away from the centre whichever side it started.
 *
 * **Smoke (8)** and **everything else** take the same three draws and differ
 * only in the final scale: `0.1 / 0.0 / 0.01` for smoke and `0.2 / 0.0 / 0.1`
 * for the default.
 *
 * ### The Y velocity is multiplied by zero
 *
 * Types 0, 8 and the default all end with `vy = vy * 0.0f` -- a literal zero in
 * the pool, not a store of zero, so the compiler was given `vy *= <something>`
 * with something folded to 0.0. The draw that produced it is still made and
 * still advances the generator, which is why removing it would change every
 * particle after it. **Only blood rises or falls**; everything else moves in
 * the XZ plane.

/* -------------------------------------------------------- MaintainParticles
 *
 * armv7 0x0005b260, 1,660 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Walks all 512 slots once a frame: integrates whatever is alive, draws it, and
 * frees the slot when it expires. Four behaviours, and the interesting thing is
 * that two of them feed each other.
 *
 * ### The blood cycle closes here
 *
 * A droplet that reaches the floor **spawns a splat and dies**, and the splat is
 * the droplet's type plus one:
 *
 *      2  red droplet    ->  3  red splat     NewBloodTexture
 *      4  green droplet  ->  5  green splat   NewGreenBloodTexture
 *      6  black droplet  ->  7  black splat   NewBlackBloodTexture
 *
 * via `AddParticles(type + 1, x, y, ShadowOffset + 0.05, 30.0f, 1)`. The floor
 * is `ShadowOffset` and the splat is placed a twentieth of a unit above it.
 *
 * **Only one droplet in four leaves a splat** -- `limeRand() & 3` has to come
 * out zero. The other three vanish. So `DoBlood`'s eighty bursts do not produce
 * eighty marks on the floor, and a port that drops the test will carpet the
 * stage.
 *
 * ### The four behaviours
 *
 * **Types 3, 5, 7 -- the splats.** No physics at all. They grow in place and
 * fade as they grow:
 *
 *      size  += ((i & 3) + 1) * 0.005 / limeFPSScaleFactor
 *      alpha  = size * -2 + 1
 *      dies when size passes 0.5
 *
 * The growth rate comes off the **slot index**, `(i & 3) + 1`, so four splats
 * landing together grow at four different rates without a random draw. Drawn
 * with `limeDrawFaceUpSprite` -- face *up*, because a splat lies on the floor;
 * everything else in this function is `limeDrawFaceMeSprite`.
 *
 * **Types 2, 4, 6 -- the droplets.** `PGrav` is *added* to the vertical velocity
 * each frame, so `PGrav` is negative in the data. Position integrates by
 * `v / limeFPSScaleFactor`. Alpha is `ttl / life`, which is what settles those
 * two fields: `field04` is the life it was born with and `field08` the life it
 * has left. Death is by hitting `ShadowOffset`, not by the timer.
 *
 * **Type 8 -- smoke.** `GamePaused` freezes the physics but not the draw. The
 * horizontal velocity is **halved every frame** and the size multiplied by
 * **1.05**, so smoke slows to a stop while it swells. Alpha is
 * `ttl / life * 0.55` -- smoke never reaches more than 55% opaque.
 *
 * **Type 0 and everything else.** `BloodGravity` is *subtracted* from the
 * vertical velocity -- the opposite sign convention to the droplets' `PGrav`,
 * two gravity constants pulling the same way through different arithmetic.
 * Death is by the timer. The sprite is an **animation frame chosen by fall
 * speed**:
 *
 *      frame = vz * BloodVelMul + 5.5,  clamped to 0 .. 11
 *      tex   = BloodTextures[(int)frame]
 *
 * twelve frames of droplet, picked by how fast it is falling, and the sprite is
 * **mirrored by the sign of the horizontal velocity** -- `u0 = 1, u1 = -1` going
 * one way and `u0 = 0, u1 = 1` going the other.
 *
 * ### A splat's size starts as whatever the slot last held
 *
 * `AddParticles` sets `field00` for types 2, 4, 6 and 8 only. A splat -- 3, 5 or
 * 7 -- takes the default arm, which sets three velocities and nothing else, so
 * its size is inherited from the previous occupant of the slot, and from
 * uninitialised memory the first time round. `InitParticles` clears `field08`
 * and nothing else, so there is no pass that would have zeroed it.
 *
 * The growth loop clamps at 0.5 immediately afterwards, which bounds the damage
 * but does not remove it: the first frame of a splat is drawn at the inherited
 * size. Recorded rather than fixed.
 *
 * ### State around the walk
 *
 *      limeDisableDepthWrites / limeDisableDepthTest
 *      limeEnableAlphaBlending_Basic
 *      glTexEnvf(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE, GL_MODULATE)
 *      ... the walk ...
 *      limeEnableDepthWrites / limeEnableDepthTest / limeDisableAlphaBlending
 *
 * The `glTexEnvf` is raw GL ES, named through the indirect symbol table like the
