 *
 * **The per-entry loop runs n-1 times, not n.** `subs r3, #1; cmp r3, r6; bne`

 * final entry is, it is not owned by this character.
 *
 * **Four of the six per-entry frees happen only on entry ZERO.** +0x1c, +0x20,
 * +0x2c and +0x30 are guarded by `cbnz r6` on the loop index; +0x24 and +0x34
 * are freed for every entry. So two of the pointers are shared across entries
 * and only the first one owns them.
 *
 * **The entry base is re-read from `c->[4]` after every free.** Not cached in a
 * register across the calls, which is transcribed as written: limeFree is
 * allowed to move it.
 *
 * The scene is freed only if LIME_SceneExists agrees -- reference counting, the

 *
 * Advances the idle animation of every front-end character slot, all 26 of
 * them, every frame.
 *
 * Per slot:
 *
 *      cursor += dt * speed * 0.5f                 (+0x65c += , speed at +0x660)
 *      if (IdleLists[who] == NULL) { frame = -1; }

 *              cursor -= dt * speed * 0.5f                  <- back it off
 *          frame = list[(long)cursor]
 *      }
 *      p->[0x14] = frame
 *      p->[0x5d4] = 1.0f
 *
 * ### The half
 *
 * The step is `dt * speed * 0.5`, not `dt * speed`. The 0.5 is a `vmov.f32
 * s10, #0.5` immediate, separate from anything in the data, so it is a
 * hardcoded halving of every front-end idle -- the menus run their characters
 * at half the rate their own speed field asks for.
 *
 * ### The clamp is a loop, not a modulo
 *
 * When the cursor runs past the end of the list it does not wrap and it does
 * not clamp: it **subtracts the same step repeatedly** until it is back in
 * range. With a small step that is one iteration; with a large `dt` it is
 * several. Rewriting it as `fmod` changes nothing observable and rewriting it
 * as a single subtract does, so it is transcribed as the loop it is.
 *
 * The bound is `SizeofIdleLists[who] / 4` -- a byte size turned into an entry
 * count, with the signed-division rounding the compiler emits (`n + 3` when
 * negative, then `asr #2`) transcribed rather than simplified to `/ 4`.
 *
 * ### It borrows a global around the call
 *
 * `_AnimSmoothWindowSize` is saved, set to **0x28**, `PlayerAutoSmoothAnims` is
 * called, and the old value is put back -- the same save-write-restore shape
 * `drawPage2x2BigForSettings` uses on `Settings[3]`. So front-end characters
 * smooth over a 40-frame window whatever the game is using, and nothing else
 * ever sees the change.
 *
 * A slot with no idle list gets frame -1 and still goes through the smoothing.

 * armv7 0x0005c16c, 456 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Draws one fighter: the body, the optional second skin, and the shadow --
 * three matrix-bracketed passes over the same frame record.
 *
 * Both frame indices are clamped the same way `IsAFrameVisible` clamps its own:
 * negatives to zero via `bic rN, rN, rN asr #31`, then down to `count - 2`.
 * **Minus two again**, so the last frame is unreachable here too. The frame
 * record is at `frames + idx * 88`.
 *
 * ### The shadow is the mesh flattened, not a separate asset
 *
 *      glColor4f(0, 0, 0, 1)
 *      glTranslatef(0, (y - ShadowOffset) * -100 + ShadowHeightFromGround, 0)
 *      glScalef(1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f)
 *      LIME_RenderMeshSingleIndexed(frame, NULL, ...)
 *
 * **`glScalef(1, 0, 1)` collapses Y to zero** -- the same geometry, squashed
 * onto the ground plane and painted black. There is no shadow mesh and no
 * shadow texture; a port that goes looking for one will not find it.
 *
 * The height is `(y - ShadowOffset) * -100 + ShadowHeightFromGround`. The
 * **-100** is a pool literal, not a scale anyone would guess, and it inverts
 * the sign: a fighter further from `ShadowOffset` puts its shadow further the
 * other way. `ShadowHeightFromGround` then lifts the whole thing off the floor
 * so it does not z-fight with it.
 *
 * The shadow pass reuses the vertices the body pass generated -- there is no
 * second skinning call -- so it is exactly the pose that was just drawn.
 *
 * ### The second skin, and the same per-character exception a third time
 *
 * The SKIN2 pass runs when `c[0x30]` points at something live and either the
 * frame's `+0x28` flag is set **or** `frame == 365 && character == 6`.
 *
 * That pair is the same exception `IsAFrameVisible` carries, and this is the
 * third function to hardcode it (`IsFrameVisible` has 12/295). It is not a
 * visibility quirk -- character 6's frame 365 genuinely needs the second skin,
 * and the flag in the data does not say so.
 *
 * SKIN2 draws with `c[0x20]` as its texture and passes 1 as the last argument
 * where the body pass passes 0.
 *
 * ### A debug line that shipped
 *
 *      LIME_printf(0x1b, "Player SKIN %s at fr %d is VISIBLE\n", name, frame)
 *
 * on every visible body, every frame. Level 0x1b presumably gates it at
 * runtime; the call is unconditional.
 *
 * The body colour is `(grey, grey, grey, 1)` from the caller -- one scalar for
 * all three channels, so a fighter can only be darkened, never tinted.

 *
 * armv7 0x0005bb44, 656 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * Interpolates the fighter's pose between recorded history frames, so the
 * animation plays back smoothly at a rate the source frames do not have.
 * Called every frame from `AnimateFECharacters`,
 * `UpdateIntroCharacterPlayers` and `RenderAnimatedCharacter`'s callers, each
 * of which borrows `_AnimSmoothWindowSize` around the call.
 *
 * Each call first records the present: current frame, current position and the
 * flag at +0x540 go into the three rings at `cursor & 0x3f`.
 *
 * ### It plays back DELAYED, by exactly the smoothing window
 *
 * The sample point is `cursor - AnimSmoothWindowSize`, not `cursor`. So the
 * pose drawn is the one from `window` frames ago -- 40 frames back in the front
 * end, 20 in the intro. That latency is not a side effect of smoothing; it is
 * how the function can see both sides of a frame change before deciding how to
 * blend across it.
 *
 * ### Finding the run
 *
 * From the sample point it walks **backwards up to 31 entries** and **forwards
 * up to 63** while the recorded frame id stays the same, which brackets the run
 * of identical frames the sample sits inside. The midpoint of that run is
 *
 *      mid = back + (runLength + 1) * 0.5f
 *
 * and which half the sample falls in decides the direction of the blend:
 *
 *      first half:   t = 0.5f + 0.5f * (sample - back) / ((run + 1) * 0.5f)
 *                    LerpVector3(posBefore, posNow, t, p->pos)
 *
 *      second half:  t = 0.5f * (sample - mid) / (forward - mid)
 *                    LerpVector3(posNow, posAfter, t, p->pos)
 *
 * So the pose eases from the previous frame's position into the current one
 * across the first half of a held frame, and out towards the next across the
 * second. The two `t` ranges meet at 0.5 in the middle -- the first arm ends at
 * 1.0 and the second begins at 0.0, which is why the source vectors differ
 * between the arms rather than the factor being continuous.
 *
 * ### Four ways to refuse to smooth
 *
 * The blend is skipped and both frames set to the same value -- a hard cut --
 * when any of:
 *
 *      the run is longer than the window will reach (`0x3f - window < back`,
 *          or the forward run is shorter than the window)
 *      the character is 16 and its frame is between 35 and 41
 *      `IsLiaProblem(p)` or `IsOstrichProblem(p)`
 *      any of the 64 frame slots still holds -1 -- the ring is not full yet
 *
 * The last one is what stops a freshly loaded character being interpolated
 * against garbage, and the -1 scan runs over **all 64** entries every call, not
 * just the ones in the window.
 *
 * **The Lia and Ostrich checks run even on the smoothing path**, after the
 * blend has already been written, and overwrite it with a hard cut. So those
 * two functions have the last word.
 *
 * The 35..41 range is written as one unsigned compare (`frame - 0x23 <= 6`),
 * the same folding that appears in `RunGameEvents`.

 *      otherwise                   the bit is stripped and the frame is kept
 *
 * So the fatality animations are not in memory unless something asked for them
 * first. That is the mechanism a port has to keep if it wants the same memory
 * ceiling; drop it and every character costs its finishers up front.
 *
 * `WantFrames` is 0x1c4c = 7,244 bytes, one flag a frame, and the function
 * sets all of them before it starts.
 *
 * ### `.lighting` is per-mesh colour blocks
 *
 * `DrawSkinnedMesh2` is called twice on the **first mesh only**, with the
 * shared `RenderVerts` / `RenderUVs` / `RenderRGBs` scratch buffers, and both
 * calls are used for their *return value* rather than for drawing -- they
 * measure the two colour-buffer sizes. Those sizes are then reused for every
 * mesh, and the file is sliced by them:
 *
 *      memcpy(mesh->cols,  lighting + i * (size1 + size2),         size1)
 *      memcpy(mesh->cols2, lighting + i * (size1 + size2) + size1, size2)
 *
 * so `STATICLIGHTING/<name>.lighting` is an array of `size1 + size2` byte
 * blocks, one a mesh, in mesh order. The file is freed as soon as the copy is
 * done. See [meshset-format.md](../../OUTPUT/meshset-format.md), which
 * documented the container without knowing what indexed it.
 *
 * ### A mesh below 0.5 loses its colour buffers
 *
 * After the copy, a mesh whose meshbase scalar is under 0.5 -- and which is not
 * mesh 0 and not mesh 0x16d -- has both colour buffers freed and every related
 * field zeroed. It keeps its geometry and gives up its per-vertex colour. That
 * is a memory decision baked into the data, not the code: change the scalar in
 * the meshbase file and the mesh keeps or loses its colours.
 *
 * ### The texture matrix
 *
 * The sixth argument is the texture base name and the fifth-to-last decides the
 * detail level. `UseLOWAssets` picks the low column; a frame list literally
 * named `dummyframes.txt` picks the dummy column.
 *
 *      field     normal                  low                    dummy
 *      +0x14     %s_DIFFUSE_LITE.PNG     %s_DIFFUSE_LOW.PNG     DUMMY_DIFFUSE_LITE.PNG
 *                %s_DIFFUSE.PNG          %s_DIFFUSE2_LOW.PNG    DUMMY_DIFFUSE.PNG
 *      +0x18     %s_DIFFUSE_ICE.PNG      --                     DUMMY_DIFFUSE_ICE.PNG
 *      +0x24     %s_DIFFUSE2_LITE.PNG    %s_DIFFUSE2.PNG        DUMMY_DIFFUSE_LITE.PNG
 *                %s_DIFFUSE_LITE2.PNG
 *      +0x28     %sBABY2.PVR, and if that misses, %sBABILITY2.PVR
 *
 * The babality texture is the only one with a **fallback name**, and the two
 * spellings are what a port's asset extractor has to try in that order.
 *
 * ### Two characters get a texture nobody else does
 *
 *      who == 0x10    JADE_DIFFUSE_GREEN.PNG   ->  +0x1c
 *      who == 6       SINDEL_HAIR_DIFF.PVR     ->  +0x20
 *
 * 16 is JADE and 6 is SINDEL in [ROSTER.md](../../docs/ROSTER.md), and these
 * are the asset names agreeing with a table that was built from switch
 * statements and symbol gaps. Jade's green is her invisibility tint and
 * Sindel's is her hair, which is the only hair in the game with its own sheet.
 *
 * ### The struct
 *
 * `limeMalloc(0x44, "animatedcharacter")`, so an `ANIMATEDCHARACTER` is
 * **68 bytes**, and the per-mesh record is **0x58 = 88**.
 *
 * ### All three failure paths print and then crash
 *
 * The struct allocation, the meshbase file and the mesh-record allocation each
 * have a check, and each one calls `Error` and then **branches back into the
 * normal flow with the null pointer still in hand**:
 *
 *      "LAC: outofmem1"            -> then writes the skin through the null
 *      "LAC: Filenotfound"         -> then reads the header out of the null
 *      "LAC: meshbase out of ram"  -> then fills records through the null
 *
 * None of them returns. So the messages are what you would see a fraction of a
 * second before the crash, not instead of it. A port that turns them into a
 * clean failure is changing behaviour, and should say so.
 *
 * ### The three trailing longs
 *
 * `p` gates the lite texture set, `q` gates loading the scene at all, and `r`
 * gates the babality sheet and doubles as the last two arguments to
 * `limeLoadTexture`. `Load1Character` passes `(a, 1, b)` and
 * `Preload1Character` passes `(a, b, who == PLAYER1MODEL)`, which is as far as
 * the call sites pin them down -- not far enough to name them, so they keep the
 * prototype's letters.
