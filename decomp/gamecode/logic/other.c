 * The fight engine runs on cooperative "threads": each player object owns a

 * Hand-written from the disassembly of the armv7 slice and verified against
 * the oracle: tests/test_switchqueue_diff.c.
 *
 * The entry points into this system, all confirmed present in the binary:

 *   _KillSThread      0x00056cbc
 *   _KillProc         0x00056d14

 *   _UnstackSwitches  0x000573e8
 *   _clear_queues     0x00058974
 *
 * Note _DoSwitchJump reaches its target through a table of function pointers,

 * nothing here supports that, and the five calls it makes are all

 *
 * The two reads are the SAME FIELD of two GrObj entries: the offsets are 0x24
 * and 0x70, and 0x70 - 0x24 is 76 -- `GROBJ_STRIDE` exactly, arrived at from
 * the other direction. `StartGrObjAt` got that 76 out of a modular inverse the
 * compiler used to avoid a divide; this function reaches it by writing two
 * offsets down. Two independent derivations agreeing is what makes the stride
 * safe to build on.
 *
 * So a GrObj entry plus 0x24 is the character, and three consecutive values --
 * 0x17, 0x18, 0x19 -- forbid the finisher for whichever side holds one. Three
 * in a row at the end of a range is the shape of a roster's non-selectable
 * tail; which characters they are is not in this function and is not guessed
 * here.
 *
 * The two SIGNED halfwords at G+0x45e and G+0x460 are the **clock**: `t_clock3`
 * writes the low digit into the first and the high into the second, packs them
 * a nibble apart for the display, and calls `t_round_timeout` when both reach
 * zero. So "either non-zero" is "there is time left", and the finisher is
 * offered only while the clock is still running.
 *
 * That is why `t_round_timeout` clears them: not as a side effect but because
 * clearing them IS the clock reaching zero. Three functions read at different
 * times, and the meaning only appears with all three.
 *
 * The two character numbers are left behind in 0x1c and 0x20, written before
 * the test rather than after, so a caller can read them whatever the answer.

 *
 * The stack is filled **downward** from the cursor and consumed **upward** to
 * 31. That is why `UnstackSwitches` loops while the cursor is at or below 31
 * and increments: the two meet in the middle of a thirty-two entry array, and
 * the cursor is the boundary rather than a count.
 *
 * A press is id `i` and a release is `i + 32`, so `_swtab` has sixty-four
 * entries -- one per switch per edge -- of sixteen bytes each.
 *
 * When the cursor reaches zero the stack is full and further entries are
 * **dropped silently**: the loop keeps running and the store is simply
 * skipped. No error, no overwrite. Transcribed as it stands.
 *
 * The first parameter is DEAD. `swscan` passes the live switch word and r0 is
 * zeroed on the first instruction to become the bit counter. It is kept in the
 * signature because the call site passes it and the ABI is part of what is
 * being recorded.

 * ends it. Each word read is left in 0x1c on the way past, which is how the
 * caller sees the last one.
 *
 * **The stance resumes.** The animation position is saved before the stance is
 * loaded and put back afterwards, but only if it falls between the script's
 * base and its terminator -- that is, only if it was already a position inside
 * this same stance. A fighter returning to stance from a stance carries on;
 * one arriving from anywhere else starts at the beginning. Both comparisons

 *
 * That asymmetry is the whole of what makes an AI opponent in a fighting game.
 * A port that unifies the two -- giving the computer a button, or the player an
 * action test -- would be simpler and would not be this game.
 *
 * 0x701 sets 0x14 as well as 0x5c, and so does the human path when bit 1 of
 * G[index] is set. So 0x14 is the low block, told apart from the high one, and
 * the two paths reach the same output from unrelated evidence.
 *
 * The halfword at H+0x1c short-circuits everything: while it is non-zero
 * nobody is blocking at all, whichever kind of player they are.
 *
 * The PROC is swapped for the opponent's around `check_block_bit` and put
 * back -- the borrow-and-restore this file does everywhere, here across a call
 * in another translation unit.
 *
 * G is indexed by word from its base, so the bit tested lives in the first two
 * words of the whole structure. Everything else in this file reaches G at

 * The shift is written as a byte loop over nine iterations with a pointer and

 *
 * The table is G+0x3fc, which is not one of the four `get_tsl_px` swaps for

 *

 * level -- its handler AND its first word -- and then overwrites both.
 *
 * That copy is an idiom, not noise: `t_clock_ran_out` emits the same six
 * instructions and does NOT overwrite the handler half, so it means "drop a
 * level and take my place in it". Here the handler is replaced immediately
 * afterwards by a different one, which is what makes this routine a return
 * that replaces its caller rather than one that carries itself down. The
 * stores are dead in this instance and the shape is not.
 *
 * The frame <= 0 case reaches the same install after writing
 * `t_local_reaction_exit` at the same slot, which is likewise overwritten. So
 * at the bottom of the stack this routine still becomes the morph rather than
 * exiting.

 * What runs after a round is won -- `t_player_1_won` and `t_player_2_won` both

 *
 * **Two round wins ends it.** `H[0]` and `H[1]` are the tallies those two
 * routines increment, and this compares one of them against 2. That is
 * best-of-three, and it is the only place the number appears.
 *
 * The winner in G+0x45c is one-based, so it is turned into an index by
 * subtracting one -- and the bounds check is done on the UNSIGNED difference:
 * `(uint16_t)(w - 1) <= 1` accepts 1 and 2 and rejects 0 in a single
 * comparison, because 0 - 1 wraps to 0xffff. A signed test would have needed
 * two.
 *
 * `Pp[w-1].field10 & 1` is the same bit `t_is_endurance_possible` reads on the
 * same struct, so that flag gates both the endurance queue and the end of the
 * match. What it means is not in either function.
 *
 * RoundParam+0x3c gates the whole thing -- a sixth field of that struct, after
 * 0x0c, 0x10, 0x14, 0x18 and 0x2c. With it clear the match never ends here.

 * rest. `t_do_jump_up` sets all three of its numbers, so none of them is 0xd
 * there -- the sentinel only shows when some other caller wants a partial
 * flight.
 *
 * It installs the callback `t_flight_loop` reads: the PROC's 0x34 takes the
 * object's 0x34, which `t_do_jump_up` loaded out of 0x48 before starting. That
 * is the whole path by which a jump gets a routine of its own, and it crosses
 * three functions.
 *
 * The animation resolution is a THIRD form of the tagged union: at or below
 * 0x48 it is a plain number for `get_char_ani`; above that, if the low half is
 * at or below 0x47 AND the high half is exactly 1, the low half is a number
 * for `get_char_ani2`. Two halves and two resolvers, chosen by a value in the
 * high half rather than by a range.
 *
 * The last step clamps y up to the ground when it has gone past -- `strh` under
 * `lt`, so it only ever moves the fighter back onto the floor and never off it.
 *
 * 0x28 goes onto the argument stack at the start and comes off at the end,

 * slot is a velocity.
 *
 * There are two reasons to keep going and they park on the same token: the

 * floor. Either one alone would be wrong, because a rising fighter is above

 *
 * The optional callback is the same one `t_flight_loop` runs, read from the
 * PROC's 0x34, with the same A10-across-the-call and the same pair of tokens
 * six apart. Two loops share the mechanism and differ in the physics.
 *
 * On the first entry 0x20 seeds the velocity, and it is skipped when zero --
 * so a zero there means "keep whatever velocity is already set" rather than
 * "start from rest". `t_flight_call` uses 0xd for that idea in a different
 * slot; this one uses 0.
 *
 * The PROC's 0x44 is cleared on landing -- the hit count `back_to_normal_px`
 * reads to decide whether a combo happened. So landing ends a combo.

 *
 * and `t_play_1_round` writes the first six stores inline rather than calling
 * any of them. Four readings of one routine from four addresses, agreeing
 * field for field -- which is what makes each a check on the others rather
 * than a repetition.
 *
 * **The two memcpy lengths are the two strides**, 140 and 76. Every earlier
 * derivation -- the modular inverse in `StartGrObjAt`, the shift-and-add in
 * `getobjectinsert`, the two offsets in `is_finish_him_allowed`, the three
 * multiplies in `Endurance_ClearPlayer` and in `DoSwitchJump` -- gave the
 * distance from one entry to the next. These give the number of bytes actually
 * copied, which is the first evidence that the entries are that SIZE and not
 * merely that far apart.
 *
 * "Tells the owner" is `owner->field1c = &Pp[i]`, a second return value handed
 * back through the argument. `getprc_x` also clears that slot on entry, so a
 * caller that fails to get a thread finds a zero there rather than the last
 * clone's address.
 *
 * The handler out of `owner->field38` is the slot `fastxfer_thread` takes a
 * thread function from and `react_xfer_him` writes a reaction into -- "the
 * routine this object is about to become".
 *
 * The index is recomputed from `th->player` for every store, eight or nine
 * times over, so each disassembly repeats the same five instructions again and
 * again. Written once here.
