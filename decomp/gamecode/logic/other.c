 * other.c — src/gamecode/logic/other.c (process scheduler)
 *
 * The fight engine runs on cooperative "threads": each player object owns a
 * PROC, and state changes are queued rather than applied directly. This file
 * is the queueing side of that machinery.
 *
 * Hand-written from the disassembly of the armv7 slice and verified against
 * the oracle: tests/test_switchqueue_diff.c.
 *
 * The entry points into this system, all confirmed present in the binary:
 *
 *   _StartThreadAt    0x00056cac
 *   _KillSThread      0x00056cbc
 *   _KillProc         0x00056d14
 *   _SwitchQueue      0x00055ed4   <- implemented here
 *   _DoSwitchJump     0x00055efc   <- dispatches through function pointers
 *   _QueueAndJump     0x000572b8
 *   _UnstackSwitches  0x000573e8
 *   _clear_queues     0x00058974
 *
 * Note _DoSwitchJump reaches its target through a table of function pointers,
 * so the static recompiler cannot follow it. It has to be decompiled by hand
 * and checked by observation against the game running in touchHLE.

/*
 * The ring buffer.
 *
 * `head` is a pointer, not an index — the original advances it with a
 * post-indexed store and wraps by comparing against the end of the array.
 * Twenty slots: the wrap check is against `q + 0x54`, the writes start at
 * `q + 4`, and each entry is four bytes.

/*
 * The global game-state pointer.
 *
 * The original is NOT a function call. It loads a pointer from
 * `__DATA,__nl_symbol_ptr` at 0x000f357c, dereferences it, and reads a
 * uint16 at +0xa8:
 *
 *     ldr    r2, [pc, #0x20]     ; literal -> 0x0009d6a0
 *     add    r2, pc              ; -> 0x000f357c
 *     ldr    r2, [r2]            ; -> _G  (0x0038c1fc)
 *     ldrh.w r2, [r2, #0xa8]
 *
 * The symbol at the end of that chain is `_G`, the game's global state
 * struct. An earlier version of this file declared
 * `extern uint16_t proc_switch_counter(void)` and called it, which is
 * behaviourally equivalent under the differential test but structurally
 * wrong: there is no such function in the binary and no such name in its
 * symbol table. The name came from notes derived from a source we do not
 * use. What the binary does is read a field, so that is what this says.
 *
 * The field's purpose — a scheduling generation counter — is inferred from
 * how the value is used, and stays inferred until something confirms it.
