 * mkcombo.c -- gamecode/logic/mkcombo.c, decompiled.
 *
 * Part of the fight engine. *
 * This first pass was read by two programs rather than by eye, because most of
 * what is here is one function written many times.
 *
 * `tools/pushfn.py` executes a body symbolically -- every register tracked as
 * a constant, a pc-relative address, a load or nothing at all -- and accepts
 * it only when it accounted for EVERY instruction and the effects come out as
 * the frame-push shape: some stores into the object, then the handler and the
 * cleared slot above. One instruction it cannot model and the function is
 * refused rather than guessed at.
 *
 * `tools/microfn.py` matches whole bodies against fixed templates for the
 * smaller shapes -- a tail call, a constant into 0x5c, a table handed to a
 * search routine -- and refuses anything with an instruction out of place.
 *
 * Both refuse loudly. What they could not prove is not in this file; it is
 * read one function at a time.

 * the base, the stride and the per-player offset, which is what makes the
 * layout certain.
 *
 * **A match means at most ONE unexpected button.** The count is of ring slots
 * that are non-empty and whose index is not `obj->a10`, and the test is
 * `seen <= 1`. So the slot named by a10 is the one allowed to differ, and one
 * more stray press is tolerated on top of it -- anything beyond that and the
 * entry is rejected and the walk moves on.
 *
 * **The list is terminated by a bit, not by a zero.** Bit 15 of the entry's
 * first word ends it, and the stride is 0x18. `last_switch_ram` is indexed by
 * the byte at +8 with an eight-byte stride, and its second word points at the
 * halfwords -- plus two for the second player, the same trick again.
 *
 * 0x48 is walked forward through the whole search and restored to `base` on
 * both exits, so the caller sees it unchanged. 0x1c, 0x20, 0x24 and 0x2c are
 * used as scratch throughout and are left holding whatever the last step put
 * there -- on a match, either the count less one or the base address, which is
 * the one place two exits disagree about what 0x1c means. */

 * the thread into t_process_combo_table. So the table says, per character,
 * whether a landed knee starts a combo string and which one.
 *
 * **A miss and an empty table entry both end the same way**, at t_retract_strike
 * with 0x1c = 6. The difference is that the empty entry first writes 0x601 into
 * the opponent proc 0x18 and waits fifteen frames; a clean miss retracts at
 * once.
 *
 * **The five constants are built by chained arithmetic off the first**, which is
 * how the compiler avoided five literals: 1, +0x108, -0xf6, -5. Only the results
 * mean anything -- 0x109 is the action number, and the elbow uses 0x10a, the
 * next one along.
 *
 * **The re-test of 0x5c at 0x32b4c is dead.** Reaching it already required 0x5c
 * to be non-zero and nothing in between can change it, so the beq back into the
 * 0x8aa body never fires. Transcribed as written; t_do_elbow, which is otherwise
 * the same routine, does not carry it.
 *

 *
 * **This is the body of a combo string: one entry per hit, walked through 0x48.**
 * The entry is the 0x18-byte record combo_scan_a11 walks, and this routine reads
 * three of its words -- +0x08 is the animation-and-rate word for the wait, +0x10
 * names the strike, +0x14 is what comes next.
 *
 * **Both packed words are read as a signed word and shifted right eight**, so
 * the useful part is bits 8 and up and the low byte is something else -- the
 * same packing a9_combo_ani takes apart, and the reason a9_combo_ani is called
 * first: it has already consumed 0x40 by the time these are read.
 *
 * **+0x14 is a pointer OR a duration, told apart by 0x100.** Above that it is
 * the next entry and the thread goes to t_comb0 to run it; at or below it is a
 * frame count, written to 0xfc and returned, and the thread comes back at token
 * 0x840 to finish through t_comb9. Either way the value is stored into 0x48
 * before the test, so on the short path 0x48 is left holding a small integer
 * where every other reader expects an address.
 *
 * strike_check answers in 0x5c, and a miss ends the string at t_combo_miss --
 * there is no retry. 0x38 keeps the entry that hit, which is the only record of
 * where the string was when it landed.
 *
 * combo_strike_table is reached through a pointer slot rather than pc-relative,
 * so unlike the ochar_* tables above it is defined in another translation
 * unit. */
