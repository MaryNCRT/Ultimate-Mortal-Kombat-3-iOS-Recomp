/*
 * mkbonus.c -- gamecode/logic/mkbonus.c, decompiled.
 *
 * Eight functions, all of them the "who won" bookkeeping that runs after a
 * match: which player gets the round, what text and character portrait the
 * ending screen shows, the closing chord, and the wind-down back to the
 * ordinary per-fighter reaction handler.
 *
 * Three of the eight -- `t_bonus_exit`, `t_bonus_count` and
 * `t_bonus_count_draw` -- are thread handlers in the `MK3THREADLONGFUNC`
 * sense: `mk3.c`'s `mk3_update` calls them as `long (*)(MK3THREAD *thread)`,
 * and they dispatch on the token `mk3_frame(thread, thread->frame + 1)[0]`
 * the way every other driver in this directory does. The other five --
 * `get_winner_ochar`, `get_winner_text`, `play_ending_chord`,
 * `_do_winner_char`, `_do_winner_text` -- take the OBJECT the thread controls
 * (`(MK3OBJ *)thread->proc`, per mk3logic.h's note on that field), not the
 * thread itself, which is how `send_code_a3`, `tsound_func` and `create_fx`
 * are already declared elsewhere in this directory.
 *
 * ## Verification status
 *
 * This file compiles clean under `-Wall -Wextra -std=c99` and is meant to
 * pass `tools/symcheck.py` (every callee resolves to a real symbol) and
 * `tools/instck.py` (no push_handler/install confusion). It has **not** been
 * run against `tools/armrecomp/recomp.py`'s differential oracle -- that tool
 * needs `capstone`, which was not installable in the session that produced
 * this file. Every instruction below was read from `llvm-objdump`'s Mach-O
 * disassembly of the same armv7 slice `tools/macho.py` produces, and the
 * reader was cross-checked against the already-verified `_SwitchQueue`
 * (other.c) before being trusted on anything new. Treat this file as a
 * careful transcription pending the oracle, not as landed to the project's
 * usual bar.
 *
 * ## The dispatch tokens
 *
 * `t_bonus_count`'s outer switch is on a token stored by the PREVIOUS call,
 * not a state number in call order: 0, 0x73 ('s'), 0x79, 0x7e, 0x84, 0xcf.
 * None of them is sequential, which matches this directory's habit of naming
 * states as ASCII-ish tags rather than 0, 1, 2. The chain this file drives:
 *
 *      0     -- first call: read the two win counters (G+0x368, G+0x36c);
 *               tied -> install t_bonus_count_draw; otherwise show the
 *               winner's text/character/chord and set the next token to 0x73
 *      0x73  -- tsound the winner (ochar 0x19 goes through rsnd_func and
 *               0x79 instead -- see the note on that function)
 *      0x79 / 0x7e -- shared entry: if either counter hit 0xa6, play a
 *               fanfare and fall to 0x84 after a 0x5a-frame wait; otherwise
 *               fall straight into 0x84
 *      0x84  -- G+0x450 / G+0x458 pick a `fatality_animations` entry and
 *               `create_fx` it; next token 0xcf, 2-frame wait
 *      0xcf  -- install `t_bonus_exit`, which unwinds the thread's nested
 *               handler stack one level per call and finally installs
 *               `t_local_reaction_exit` (joy.c) to hand the thread back
 *
 * The return values along this chain (0x6e, 2, 0x5a, and the incoming token
 * itself on the ochar-0x19 detour) do not fit `mk3_frame`'s documented
 * 0 / negative / `MK3_THREAD_DONE` enum. They are transcribed exactly as the
 * register holds them; `thread->fieldfc`, set on every path here, is what
 * actually paces the wait, and the return value may simply not be read by
 * anything that reaches this handler. Flagged rather than silently rounded
 * to 0.
