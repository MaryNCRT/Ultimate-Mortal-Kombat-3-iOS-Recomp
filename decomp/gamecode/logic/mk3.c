/*
 * mk3.c -- gamecode/logic/mk3.c, decompiled.
 *
 * Nineteen functions, and they are the ones that turn everything else in this
 * directory into a running fight: the per-frame tick, the thread list every
 * object lives on, the input translation, gravity and the screen bounds, the
 * event queue, and the two init routines.
 *
 * It was left until last because `tools/progress.py` could not see it -- the
 * per-file table skipped any source with nothing written, so this file and six
 * others were invisible for weeks. Fixed in the session this file was opened.
 *
 * ## THIRTY. The number this file settles.
 *
 * Six globals, all reached through pointer slots, and the gaps between their
 * symbols measure every one of them:
 *
 *      _GrObj         0x0038c698   2280 bytes = 30 x  76   GROBJ_STRIDE
 *      _MKEventQueue  0x0038cf80     84 bytes = 4 + 10 x 8
 *      _Plyr          0x0038cff4   3240 bytes = 30 x 108   PLYR_STRIDE
 *      _Pp            0x0038dc9c   4200 bytes = 30 x 140   PP_STRIDE
 *      _TList         0x0038ed48      the live thread list
 *      _TList_Free    0x0038ed4c      the free list they come from
 *      _mytc          0x0038ef3c   8040 bytes = 30 x 268   MK3THREAD_STRIDE
 *
 * **Four parallel arrays of exactly thirty, and the strides are the four this
 * project had been assembling one function at a time.** Every one of them now
 * divides its array exactly, which is as close to proof as a symbol table gets.
 *
 * So the engine's hard limit is **thirty live things at once** -- two fighters
 * and twenty-eight everything-else -- and a thread, a fighter, a proc and a
 * GrObj with the same index are the same entity seen four ways. `MK3THREAD`'s
 * 0x100 is the index that ties them together, and `TList_Init` below writes it
 * once and never again.
 *
 * **The event queue is 4 + 10 x 8 bytes.** `MKEvent_Add` refuses an eleventh
 * with a `cmp #9`, and the symbol gap says the array behind it really is ten
 * long -- so the refusal is a bound, not a policy, and raising it in a port
 * needs the array grown too.

 * bound and not a throttle someone can just raise.
 *
 * That is worth knowing before a port "improves" it: code elsewhere may depend
 * on events being dropped under load rather than queued up and delivered a
 * frame or two late, which is a different bug and a much harder one to see.
 *
 * **`param` is stored through the ADVANCED index.** `r1` is `count + 1`, needed
 * for the count store at the end, and the compiler reuses it: `[sb, r1, lsl #3]`
 * is `queue + (count+1)*8`, which is `queue + 4 + count*8 + 4` -- the `param`
 * field of record `count`. One register doing two jobs, and the same
 * shared-literal habit this directory is full of, applied to an index.
 *
 * **The first argument is sign-extended on the way in** (`sxtb r0`) and the
 * field is a signed char, so a type above 127 arrives negative. The callers
 * measured so far pass 1 and 3.
 *
 * The argument order is not the field order -- `type`, `subtype`, `param`,
 * `player` going in, landing at bytes 0, 2, word 4, byte 1 -- but the callers
 * read naturally with it: mkfatal.c's `MKEvent_Add(3, 9, 0, 0)` is type 3

 *
 * Nine bits come in per player -- four directions and six buttons -- and they
 * are spread into one word, one player in the low half and one in the high:
 *
 *      in bit   0..3   ->  out  0..3     P1 directions
 *      in bit   4      ->  out  4        P1 button, low group
 *      in bit   6      ->  out  5        P1 button, low group
 *      in bit   7      ->  out  6        P1 button, low group
 *      in bit   5      ->  out 16        P1 button, high group
 *      in bit   8      ->  out 17        P1 button, high group
 *      in bit   9      ->  out 18        P1 button, high group
 *
 *      in bit   0..3   ->  out  8..11    P2 directions
 *      in bit   4      ->  out 12        P2 button, low group
 *      in bit   6      ->  out 13        P2 button, low group
 *      in bit   7      ->  out 14        P2 button, low group
 *      in bit   5      ->  out 20        P2 button, high group
 *      in bit   8      ->  out 21        P2 button, high group
 *      in bit   9      ->  out 22        P2 button, high group
 *
 * **The six buttons are split into two groups of three, and the split is not
 * arbitrary: it is input bits {4,6,7} against {5,8,9}.** Read down the list and
 * the two groups land as 0x00000070 / 0x00070000 for P1 and 0x00007000 /
 * 0x00700000 for P2.
 *
 * Or, in one number each: **0x00070070 and 0x00707000.** Those are, to the bit,
 * the two masks `buttons_in_a2` in moves.c picks between on the strength index:
 *
 *      obj->field28 = 0x00070070;  if (strength) obj->field28 = 0x00707000;
 *      obj->field24 = G[0x1c] & obj->field28;
 *
 * **That file was decompiled long before this one, from a different function,
 * and the two agree exactly.** It is the strongest confirmation this project
 * has produced for any layout: the writer and the reader were read
 * independently and the bits line up.
 *
 * It also says what the masks mean. `buttons_in_a2` masks off the DIRECTIONS
 * and keeps the six buttons -- so a move lookup sees buttons only, and the
 * directions are read by something else.
 *
 * The buttons are deliberately NOT named here. Which of the six is high punch
 * and which is block is not decidable from this routine, and the arcade layout
 * is a question for MAME and the ROM, not for a guess written into a header.
 *
 * ## Bit 0x400: the escape hatch
 *
 * Bit 10 of an incoming word means **do not translate me**. The low ten bits
 * are then dropped, unchanged, into `G[0x08]` (P1) or `G[0x0c]` (P2) -- a
 * DIFFERENT pair of slots from the translated output, and the two are shadowed
 * into `G[0x10]` / `G[0x14]` at the top of every call, so something wants both
 * this frame's and last frame's copy.
 *
 * **The raw path contributes nothing to `G[0x1c]`.** A player whose word has bit
 * 10 set is, as far as `buttons_in_a2` and every other consumer of 0x1c is
 * concerned, pressing nothing at all.
 *
 * **What bit 10 means is settled by `mk3_update`, the only caller**, and the
 * answer arrived a few hours after this note first guessed at it. The guess was
 * demo playback, because `_Playback` sits near `_Plyr` in the symbol table. It
 * was wrong, and it is recorded here as wrong because a tested prediction is
 * worth more in the file than a quiet correction.
 *
 * **Bit 10 marks a SPECIAL-MOVE REQUEST, and the low ten bits name the move.**
 * `mk3_update` consumes it twice, before and after this routine:
 *
 *   - Before, when `RoundParam[0x34]` is set: `seq_lookup` turns the ten bits
 *     into a recorded stick sequence and `Playback` then synthesises an
 *     ordinary joystick word every frame. The special move is replayed as if
 *     someone had done the motion, so by the time this routine runs the word is
 *     a normal one and bit 10 is gone.
 *   - After, for any word that still carries it: `DoSpecial` is called on that

 * `Playback` was the right global for the wrong reason.

 * Still open: **nothing decompiled reads 0x10 or 0x14**, the previous-frame

 *
 * ## For the port
 *
 * A keyboard or a gamepad has to produce exactly two words here, nine bits
 * each, bit 10 clear. That is the entire contract. There is no touch anywhere
 * in this routine and never was -- the touch layer sits above it, in the iOS
 * code that fills `joy[]`, and replacing that layer replaces the input method

 *
 *      if (part->0x20 != 0) part->0x1c += part->0x20
 *
 * **Two unrelated jobs in one routine, and the name admits it.** The bounds are
 * horizontal and the gravity is vertical, and they share a function only
 * because `DisplayUpdate` wanted one call per object.
 *
 * ## The bounds
 *
 * The arena is `[G[0xb0] + 0x3a, G[0xb4] + 0x15f]`, and **GameCode.c already
 * knew what those two are.** `SetupLevelLimits` there writes:
 *
 *      RoundParam[0] = Level_Info[lvl].leftPlayerLimit
 *      RoundParam[1] = Level_Info[lvl].rightPlayerLimit
 *      G[0xb0]       = RoundParam[0]
 *      G[0xb4]       = RoundParam[1] - 399
 *
 * Substitute, and the walls are exactly
 *
 *      left  = leftPlayerLimit  + 58
 *      right = rightPlayerLimit - 48          ; -399 + 351
 *
 * So the two hard-coded insets in this routine are **58 pixels in from the
 * level's own left limit and 48 in from its right**, and a port that reads the
 * level data has everything it needs. The asymmetry is real: the two insets are
 * not the same number.
 *
 * They are NOT the camera pair at 0x468/0x470 that four other routines use --
 * `SetupLevelLimits` derives `CamLeftLimit` and `CamRightLimit` from the same
 * two limits with two DIFFERENT margins. **The walls and the camera are two
 * different insets off one pair of limits**, which is why a fighter can be
 * against a wall with the camera still moving.
 *
 * 0x15f is assembled as `0x15c` then `+3`, in two instructions, because it is
 * not a Thumb-2 modified immediate. Not a shared literal -- just the encoding.
 *
 * **Hitting a wall zeroes the velocity INTO it and leaves the other direction
 * alone**: `< 0` on the left, `> 0` on the right. So a fighter pinned against
 * the left wall can still be pushed right on the same frame, and 0x18 is the
 * horizontal velocity.
 *
 * ## The override
 *
 * **Bit 10 of `part->0x30` turns the walls off entirely** -- both of them, each
 * tested separately with the same mask. That is how anything leaves the arena:
 * a pit fall, a body flying off the bell tower, a projectile that should not
 * stop at the edge. A port that clamps unconditionally traps all of them at the
 * wall, and the symptom will look like a physics bug rather than a missing flag.
 *
 * Bit 10 is 0x400, the same numeric value as `TranslateJoybits`' escape hatch
 * above, on a different word in a different struct. Coincidence, noted here so
 * nobody connects them.
 *
 * ## The gravity
 *
 * `part->0x1c += part->0x20`, guarded by `0x20 != 0`. So **0x20 is the
 * acceleration and 0x1c is the vertical velocity**, and the guard means an
 * object with no gravity set costs a compare instead of a read-modify-write.
 * Nothing here integrates velocity into position -- that happens elsewhere, and
 * this routine only feeds it.
 *
 * The pairing is what makes the reading safe: 0x18 is the horizontal velocity
 * (zeroed at a wall), 0x1c the vertical one (accumulated into), 0x20 the
 * constant added to it. Three adjacent words, one meaning each.
 *
 * **This is jumping.** A jump is a negative 0x1c and a positive 0x20; the arc
 * comes out of this one add.

 *      0x10   y, 16.16 fixed point -- its high half is the halfword at 0x12

 *      0x1c   y velocity, added to 0x10 once a frame, HERE
 *      0x20   gravity, added to 0x1c once a frame, in `gravity_n_bounds`
 *      0x30   flags; bit 10 turns the arena walls off
 *
 * **`MK3OBJ.field08` is a pointer into `GrObj`.** That is what ties this
 * function to the last one: `gravity_n_bounds` takes an `MK3OBJ *`, works on
 * `obj->field08`, and touches 0x0e, 0x18, 0x1c, 0x20 and 0x30 -- every one of
 * them a `GrObj` field, and `mk3_bloodevent` reads 0x0e and 0x12 off a `GrObj`
 * by index to get a position. The "part" this directory has been calling
 * `field08` for twenty files is a GrObj record.
 *
 * And the 16.16 split is the one mk3logic.h already documents for `MK3OBJ`'s
 * own 0x0c and 0x10 -- "x and y as 16.16 fixed point, with the integer part on
 * top and a fraction underneath that only a copy preserves". **The same layout,
 * at the same offsets, in the other struct.** So the fraction is not decorative:
 * it is where sub-pixel movement accumulates between frames, and a port that
 * keeps positions as integers gets visibly different motion.
 *
 * **A jump is one negative 0x1c and one positive 0x20**, and the arc is these
 * two adds. Nothing else is involved.
 *
 * ## The walk starts at mytc[1].next, not at TList
 *
 * The two fighters are `mytc[0]` and `mytc[1]`, handled above by name, and the
 * loop picks up whatever is linked after them. `TList_Get` appends at the tail,
 * so **everything it ever allocates lands on this chain** -- which is why the
 * loop can start there and skip exactly the two objects already done.
 *
 * But `TList_GetFront` links at the HEAD, in front of `mytc[0]`. **A thread
 * taken from the front is never integrated by this loop.** It gets no velocity
 * applied at all. That is a real difference between the two allocators, on top
 * of the execution-order one, and it is invisible from either allocator alone.
 * `mk3_init` is the only caller of `TList_GetFront` found so far, which is
 * consistent -- whatever it takes from the front is not a moving object.
 *
 * `t->player` is the slot index `TList_Init` stamped in and nobody clears, used
 * here to index `GrObj`. Fourth confirmation that the four 30-element arrays
 * are one entity seen four ways.
 *
 * `repell_func` comes first and is in mkrepell.c, which is a one-function file
 * nobody has opened. It runs before gravity, so whatever it does to velocities
 * is what gravity and the walls then correct.

 * ## How this one was read
 *
 * It is a compiled `switch` -- a balanced binary search with subtract-and-
 * compare range tests, three levels deep, spread over 332 bytes with no jump
 * table. Transcribing that by eye gets a case list wrong sooner or later and
 * nothing would ever notice, because a wrong entry here just means one
 * animation is not substituted.
 *
 * So it was not transcribed by eye. **The routine touches no memory -- it is
 * compares, branches, and `mov` of literals -- so it can be emulated exactly**,
 * and it was: every input from 0 to 0x20000 plus a handful of negatives, run
 * through an interpreter over the instruction listing, and the resulting table
 * is what the `switch` below spells out. The C was then compiled and run
 * against that same table, input by input, and agrees on all 131,072.
 *
 * That is the first function in this directory proved rather than argued, and
 * it is worth saying why it was possible: **no loads, no stores, no calls.**
 * Any function with that shape can get the same treatment.
 *
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Six outputs, 0x1aaf through 0x1ab5, with **0x1ab4 conspicuously absent** --
 * so the destination set is seven consecutive numbers with one unused, which
 * reads like a table someone removed an entry from.
 *
 * The inputs cluster, and the clusters are the interesting part:
 *
 *      -> 0x1aaf   0x3f5..0x404 (7), 0x119f..0x11a9 (9), 0x17a3/0x17a5

 * store lands at 0x40. Neither is a prefix of a bigger struct -- this routine
 * initialises the whole of both, and anything found at a higher offset in
 * either is a misreading.
 *
 * **0x1c and 0x20 are the exception and they are skipped on purpose.** Every
 * other word from 0 to 0x40 is written; those two are left as they were. The

 * and only the first of them is set here.
 *
 * ## -550 and 950 are the default arena
 *
 * `RoundParam[0]` and `RoundParam[1]` are the level's left and right player
 * limits -- GameCode.c's `SetupLevelLimits` overwrites both from
 * `Level_Info[lvl]` and derives `G[0xb0]`, `G[0xb4]` and the two camera limits
 * from them. So these two numbers are **the arena before any level has been
 * chosen**, and through `gravity_n_bounds` above they put the walls at -492 and
 * 902 until a level says otherwise.
 *
 * 1500 wide. A port that boots straight into a fight without loading level data
 * gets a working arena out of this, which is exactly what a test scene needs.
 *
 * ## The literal chain
 *
 * 5, then 1, then -1: `movs #5`, `subs #4`, `subs #2`, one register walked
 * along, and the zero for every other field is a second register held across
 * the whole routine. The shared-literal habit again -- so the three values must
 * be transcribed as the chain and not as three independent constants.

 *          GrObj[t->player].0x2c = -1
 *      }
 *      return 0
 *
 * ## The wiring loop is the answer to what the four arrays are
 *
 * Thirty iterations, three stores each, and it says outright what `mk3_dizzy`
 * and `DisplayUpdate` only implied:
 *
 *      Plyr[n].field00 -> Pp[n]          the proc
 *      Plyr[n].thread  -> mytc[n]        the thread
 *      Plyr[n].field08 -> GrObj[n]       the position and velocity
 *
 * **`MK3OBJ.field08` -- "another object", as mk3logic.h has called it for
 * twenty files -- is the GrObj with the same index.** Every `obj->field08->0x0e`
 * in this directory is a position, every `->0x18` a velocity, and the "part"
 * this project has been reading around is one of thirty physics records.
 *
 * The four strides appear one more time in the loop increments -- 0x6c, 0x8c,
 * 0x4c, 0x10c -- all four in six instructions.
 *
 * ## GAMESTATE is 1144 bytes, and that is its size
 *
 * `memset(G, 0, 0x478)`. The highest offset anything is known to read is
 * `G + 0x474`, which is the last word: 0x474 + 4 = 0x478 exactly. So **G has no
 * fields past 0x474** and any future reading that claims one is wrong.
 *
 * ## Who starts in front is a coin flip
 *
 * `G[0x474] = (random32() >> 9) & 1` -- one bit out of the generator, bit 9.
 * That word is what `mk3_who_in_front` returns, and `RenderLevelPlayers` is its
 * only caller. So **the draw order of the two fighters is randomised once per
 * init and never changes during the fight.**
 *
 * Bit 9 specifically, not bit 0. Worth keeping: a port with a different
 * generator that takes the low bit will get a different sequence of matches, and
 * a recorded demo will desynchronise on frame one.
 *
 * ## Bit 0x80 of a character number is the CPU flag
 *
 * Each fighter's thread is started at one of two routines on the high bit of its
 * character argument:
 *
 *      p & 0x80 set    -> t_drone_begin     mkdrone.c, the AI
 *      p & 0x80 clear  -> plyrthread        joy.c, a human
 *
 * and `init_players` gets `p & 0x7f`, so **the character number is seven bits
 * and the eighth says who is driving.** That is the switch a playable scene
 * needs: `mk3_init(char, char, cb)` with both high bits clear is two
 * human-controlled fighters, and it does not need `no_ai_hack` or any other
 * patch to get there.
 *
 * Six fields are set on each thread by hand rather than through
 * `StartThreadAt`: 0x04 (the function), and 0x08, 0xa4, 0xf8, 0xfc and 0x108
 * cleared or pointed at the fighter. That is `StartThreadAt`'s job written out
 * inline, which is why this routine does not call it.
 *
 * ## `init_players` clobbers the thread pointers
 *
 * `Plyr[0].thread` and `Plyr[1].thread` are written by the wiring loop and then
 * **written again, with the same values, after `init_players` returns.** A
 * compiler does not emit a redundant store to a global it cannot prove
 * unchanged -- and `init_players` is a call, so it cannot. The re-store is
 * therefore deliberate: **`init_players` damages those two pointers and this
 * repairs them.** Recorded here because it is the kind of thing a port
 * "cleans up" and then spends a day debugging.
 *
 * ## The third thread, and why it is taken from the FRONT
 *
 * `TList_GetFront` -- the only call to it anywhere -- puts a thread at the head
 * of `TList`, in front of both fighters, and starts it at `t_one_on_one`. So the
 * match referee runs BEFORE either fighter every frame.
 *
 * **And this confirms the prediction made while reading `DisplayUpdate`.** That
 * loop walks `mytc[1].next`, so a thread linked at the head is never reached and
 * never has its velocity integrated. `t_one_on_one` is exactly that: a thread
 * with a `Plyr` slot and a `GrObj` slot that does not move. The two allocators
 * differ in execution order AND in whether the object gets physics, and one
 * caller uses each.
 *
 * `GrObj[t->player].0x2c = -1` is the one field it does set, through the same
 * 76-byte multiply spelled out again.
 *
 * If the free list were empty the referee would silently not exist -- and
 * `TList_GetFront` returns NULL without complaint. It cannot happen here,
 * because `TList_Init` has just run and there are twenty-eight free.
 *
 * The return value is a literal 0 and no caller is known to read it.
 *
 * ## A fourth argument that is never read
 *
 * `r3` is not touched anywhere in the 644 bytes -- but **both callers pass
 * one.** GameCode.c's step 52 and training.c both call
 * `mk3_init(P1, P2, FrameID_GetBBox, 1)`, so the prototype is four wide and the
 * last parameter is dead. It is declared here rather than dropped, because a
 * definition that disagrees with its callers on argument count is exactly what
 * `tools/protos.py` exists to catch, and dropping it would just move the lie.
 *
 * ## GameCode.c found the CPU flag independently, and agrees
 *
 * That same note in GameCode.c was written from the CALL side, long before this
 * function was read:
 *
 *      AIOn == 0   mk3_init(P1,        P2,        cb, 1)
 *      AIOn == 1   mk3_init(P1,        P2 | 0x80, cb, 1)
 *      AIOn == 2   mk3_init(P1 | 0x80, P2 | 0x80, cb, 1)
 *
 * -- "Human vs Human", "Human vs CPU", "CPU vs CPU". **Two independent readings
 * of bit 7, from opposite ends of the same call, saying the same thing.**

 *
 * ## 0x16462 is not a duration. It is the termination sentinel.
 *
 * This project has recorded 0x16462 at eleven sites as "the park-and-never-wake
 * duration", because eleven handlers end with
 *
 *      thread->fieldfc = 0x16462;  return 0x16462;
 *
 * and the only thing known about it was that `fieldfc` counts down. **That
 * reading was incomplete, and this function completes it.** The comparison here
 * is against the RETURN VALUE, and a handler that returns 0x16462 has its
 * thread taken off `TList` and pushed back on the free list before `fieldfc` is
 * ever looked at again.
 *
 * So those eleven lines mean **"I am done, delete me"**, and the `fieldfc`
 * store is belt-and-braces that never matters. The number is a sentinel chosen
 * to be far outside any real sleep count, not a duration at all.
 *
 * The notes at those eleven sites are wrong in the same way and have been
 * corrected in place rather than deleted -- an incomplete reading that a later
 * function finishes is worth leaving visible.
 *
 * ## Releasing a thread cleans up the slave trio
 *
 * Before `TList_Release`, both fighters' procs are checked: if `Pp[i].0x64` is
 * this thread's proc, **0x64 and 0x68 are both cleared.** Those are the two
 * fields the slave trio uses -- `proc->field64` is the object and
 * `proc->slave` (0x68) is its part -- so `delete_slave`'s bookkeeping has a
 * central safety net here. A projectile that dies without tidying up does not
 * leave its owner pointing at a freed thread.
 *
 * Only the two fighters are checked. A slave owned by anything else is not
 * cleaned up, and nothing looks for one.
 *
 * ## A handler that returns 0 runs again immediately
 *
 * `if (r == 0) continue` loops back to the SAME thread, re-reading
 * `t->frame` and calling whatever handler is there now. That is how the descend
 * idiom advances within one frame: a state that pushes a level returns 0, and
 * the handler it pushed runs before the tick moves on. **Zero means "I changed
 * what I am; ask me again", not "I am done for this frame".**
 *
 * A handler that returns 0 without changing anything hangs the game in this
 * loop with no diagnostic.
 *
 * ## A negative return aborts the entire frame
 *
 * `return 1` -- immediately, skipping `DisplayUpdate`, the display list, and
 * `*out`. So the caller gets a stale `*out` and a 1. **-3 is the refusal every
 * dispatcher in this directory returns for an unknown token**, which means an
 * unhandled token does not misbehave quietly: it stops the frame dead.
 *
 * That is worth knowing for a port. `tools/instck.py` exists because 116
 * handlers were once written to refuse where the binary installs, and this is
 * what that would have looked like at run time.
 *
 * The normal return is `(uint32_t)fp >> 31` on a value that can only be zero or
 * positive by then, so **the normal path always returns 0** and the shift is a
 * compiler artefact of merging the two exits.
 *
 * ## The floor and the camera box
 *
 *      G[0xac]  = RoundParam[2] + 0xf7
 *
 * `G + 0xac` is the floor, read by ten routines across this directory, and this
 * is the one place it is written. `RoundParam[2]` is the level's ground plane --
 * Blood.c sets it to 0x12c or 0x190 -- so **the floor is the level's ground
 * plus 247**, recomputed every single frame.
 *
 *      mk3_getbbox(-1, &G[0x468], &G[0x464], &G[0x470], &G[0x46c])
 *
 * **Animation -1 means "the camera".** `G + 0x468` and `G + 0x470` are the
 * camera's left and right edges, already known from four other sites, and they
 * arrive here as the first and third outputs -- confirming the left/right
 * assignment and adding 0x464 as the top and 0x46c as the bottom. The camera
 * box is a bounding-box query with a reserved id, through the same callback
 * that measures animations.
 *
 * ## Bit 0x400 of an input word is a special-move request
 *
 * It is consumed twice, and `TranslateJoybits`' note above has been corrected
 * from this:
 *
 *   - **Here, before translation**, when `RoundParam[0x34]` is set: the low ten
 *     bits name a sequence, `seq_lookup` turns them into one, and `Playback`
 *     then synthesises an ordinary stick word every frame. **The special move
 *     is played back as if a human had done the motion.** The facing argument
 *     is `opponent_x < my_x` -- one signed compare on the two 0x0e coordinates.
 *   - **After translation**, for any word that still has the bit: `DoSpecial`
 *     is called on that fighter and the word is zeroed.
 *
 * So it is not a demo-playback flag, which is what the hypothesis in
 * `TranslateJoybits` guessed before this function was read. **The guess was
 * wrong and has been replaced there.** The `Playback` global it pointed at is
 * real and is used -- for this, not for demos.
 *
 * ## The display list
 *
 * `_mo` is 480 bytes and entries are indexed `n << 4`: **thirty records of
 * sixteen bytes**, one per slot, exactly like the other four arrays.
 *
 * Each entry is a linked node -- `mo[n-1].link = &mo[n]`, head at `mo[0]` --
 * built fresh every frame from whatever is on `TList` and visible. **A negative
 * `GrObj.0x2c` means invisible** and skips the object entirely, which is why
 * `mk3_init` sets exactly that field to -1 on the referee thread: the match
 * logic has a slot and is never drawn.
 *
 * `mo[n].0x0e` is used as a **scratch slot**: the animation number (or 0x4e20
 * when `GrObj.0x30` bit 5 is set) is parked there, read back, passed through
 * `mk3_remap`, and the result stored at 0x08 -- then 0x0e is overwritten with
 * the real value. So **`mk3_remap`'s subject is an animation number**, which
 * the note there had to leave open, and 0x4e20 is the substitute for a whole
 * class of object.
 *
 * `mo[n].0x0a` accumulates six flags out of four different `GrObj` fields, each
 * ORed in and stored back separately -- so a debugger watching that halfword
 * sees it built up in six steps. 0x80 comes from `Pp[slot].field08`, the
 * strength index, which is the same field `buttons_in_a2` uses to choose
 * between the two button masks. **`field08` is which side you are on**, and it
 * reaches the renderer as a flag and again as the low bit of `mo[n].0x0d`.
 *
 * ## For a playable scene
 *
 * `UpdateArcadeCode` passes a two-word input array and takes back a display
 * list. That is the whole interface between the fight and everything else:
 * **two words in, a linked list of sixteen-byte draw records out.** A port that
 * can fill `joy[2]` from a keyboard and draw from `mo` has a game, and needs to
 * understand nothing else in this directory to get there.
