/*
 * mkfatal.c -- gamecode/logic/mkfatal.c, decompiled.
 *
 * Part of the fight engine. *
 * This first pass was read by two programs rather than by eye, because most of
 * what is here is one function written many times.
 *
 * `tools/pushfn.py` executes a body symbolically -- every register tracked as
 * a constant, a pc-relative address, a load or nothing at all -- and accepts
 * it only when it accounted for EVERY instruction and the effects come out as
 * the frame-push shape: some stores into the object, then the handler and the
 * cleared slot above. One instruction it cannot model and the function is
 * refused rather than guessed at.
 *
 * `tools/microfn.py` matches whole bodies against fixed templates for the
 * smaller shapes -- a tail call, a constant into 0x5c, a table handed to a
 * search routine -- and refuses anything with an instruction out of place.
 *
 * Both refuse loudly. What they could not prove is not in this file; it is
 * read one function at a time.
