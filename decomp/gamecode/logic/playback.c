/*
 * playback.c -- gamecode/logic/playback.c, decompiled.
 *
 * The recorded-input player. `mk3_update` uses it for special moves: an input
 * word with bit 10 set names a sequence, `seq_lookup` finds it, and this file
 * then synthesises an ordinary joystick word every frame -- so a special move
 * is replayed as if a human had done the motion.
 *
 * Four functions. All four now written.
 *
 * ## The record is sixteen bytes
 *
 * `_Playback` is 32 bytes in the symbol table and there are two fighters, so
 * one record is 16 -- and `Playback_Begin` writes a word and four halfwords
 * inside that, which fits exactly.
 *
 *      0x00  the sequence               a word, the only thing Begin is given
 *      0x04  a halfword, cleared
 *      0x06  a halfword, cleared
 *      0x08  a halfword, cleared
 *      0x0a  the facing flag
 *      0x0c  THE OUTPUT WORD, and Begin does NOT clear it
 *
 * That last line matters. `mk3_update` reads `Playback[i].0x0c` as the
 * joystick word to use this frame, and `Playback_Begin` leaves it alone -- so
 * **the first frame of a new sequence replays whatever the previous one left
 * there**, until `Playback_Update` overwrites it. `mk3_update` does call
 * Update immediately after Begin, which is what makes that safe; a port that
 * separates the two will replay a stale input and not know why.

 *
 * armv7 0x000adaa8, 184 bytes.  **Complete.**
 *
 * **A bytecode interpreter, one instruction per frame.** The sequence is an
 * array of halfwords; bits 10..12 are the opcode and everything else -- bits
 * 0..9 and 13..15, the mask 0xe3ff -- is the payload.
 *
 *      0x0400   SET      sticky |= payload
 *      0x0800   CLEAR    sticky &= ~payload
 *      0x0C00   HOLD     hold = payload           (frames to stay put)
 *      0x1000   END      seq = NULL
 *      else     EMIT     transient = payload, for this frame only
 *                        and if the NEXT word repeats this one, hold 1
 *
 *      output = sticky | transient
 *
 * Every opcode costs a frame: SET and CLEAR emit and return like the rest, so
 * "hold left for five" is six words of wall-clock, not five. A port that
 * executes opcodes until it finds an EMIT will run every special move faster
 * than the original.
 *
 * The sticky word at 0x08 survives between frames and the transient at 0x06
 * does not -- it is cleared at the top of every call. That is the whole state
 * model: a button you hold is SET once, a tap is one EMIT.
 *
 * ## The flip settles which bits are the horizontal pair
 *
 * When `flip` is set the output has **bits 2 and 3 exchanged**, and nothing
 * else changes:
 *
 *      out = (out & 0xfff3) | ((out & 8) ? 4 : 0) | ((out & 4) ? 8 : 0)
 *
 * Mirroring a recorded motion swaps left and right and leaves up and down
 * alone. So **bits 2 and 3 are the horizontal pair and bits 0 and 1 are the
 * vertical one** -- which the input contract at the top of joy.c had to leave
 * open, because `joystick_in_a0` masks all four with 0xf and never separates
 * them.
 *
 * It does NOT say which of 2 and 3 is left: swapping a pair is symmetric. Same
 * for 0 and 1. The PAIRING is settled and the polarity is not.
 *
 * `flip` is read with `ldrsh` and tested against zero, and `mk3_update` sets it
 * from `opponent_x < my_x` -- so a sequence is authored facing one way and
 * mirrored when the fighter is facing the other.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------- seq_lookup
 *
 * armv7 0x000adb80, 7,608 bytes -- the largest function in the directory by
 * a factor of three, and the reason for it: 6,702 of those bytes are DATA,
 * not code. The 315 real instructions are a two-level dispatch; everything
 * else is the two jump tables and, past the end of the function, the
 * sequences themselves.
 *
 * **The outer level is 23 sets, an ordinary `tbh`.** `set` is checked
 * against 22 (`cmp r4, #0x16 ; bhi -> return 0`) and dispatches through a
 * halfword table -- the normal, already-documented `tbh` shape.
 *
 * **The inner level is not `tbh`. It is a table of `b.w` instructions,
 * used as data.** Each of the 23 branches lands on:
 *
 *      cmp r5, #LIMIT          ; LIMIT is 0x13, 0x12 or 0x8, per set
 *      bhi ret0
 *      addw r3, pc, #N
 *      add.w r3, r3, r5, lsl #2
 *      mov pc, r3
 *      <the table: LIMIT+1 four-byte b.w instructions, in place>
 *
 * `mov pc, r3` jumps INTO the table rather than reading a pointer out of
 * it -- so every entry has to be a real, executable `b.w`, and the table is
 * exactly as many four-byte slots as `set` has valid indices. Reading it
 * wrong by two bytes (the natural mistake: `addw r3, pc, #N` looks like it
 * should point at the table, and by the letter of the encoding it does, but
 * one register-allocator artifact -- the compiler emits `mov pc, r3` as a
 * 2-byte T1 form, not the 4-byte wide form -- lands the arithmetic one
 * halfword short) decodes each entry as an ordinary 16-bit instruction
 * instead of the top half of a `b.w`, and every target comes out
 * plausible-looking and wrong. Caught by disassembling from three
 * candidate starts and keeping the one where six consecutive decodes are
 * all `b.w` to addresses inside this same function -- the other two starts
 * each produce a `rev`/`revsh`/`it`-block salad that doesn't hang together
 * as a program.
 *
 * **Every branch this table can reach lands on the same four-instruction
 * shape:**
 *
 *      ldr r0, [pc, #N]         ; a literal: the base of one sequence table
 *      lsls r3, r6, #2
 *      lsls r2, r6, #4
 *      add  r2, r3              ; r2 = mode * 20  (4 + 16)
 *      add  r0, pc              ; r0 = the literal, resolved
 *      add  r0, r2
 *      b.w  ret0                ; shared tail, returns r0
 *
 * So **the whole function is a lookup in a fixed 23-by-(up to 20) grid of
 * table addresses**, followed by `+ mode * 20`. `SEQ_TABLE` below is that
 * grid, walked out of the binary by resolving all 23 inner tables and every
 * `b.w` each one contains -- 449 entries, of which 138 are real. The rest
 * are the `bhi ret0` refusals the binary's own range checks produce, and
 * are `NULL` here for the same reason.
 *
 * **None of the 138 table addresses have a symbol.** They sit in
 * `__TEXT,__const` (0xddf2c-0xe0404) among the 229 data tables
 * `docs/PROGRESS.md` already flags as uncounted -- this is that gap, met
 * directly rather than described. What is verified is the STRUCTURE: which
 * (set, idx) pairs are valid and where each one's table starts. What each
 * table's own bytes mean -- `_Playback`'s bytecode, per `Playback_Update`
 * above -- is a question for whoever names `sm_scorp_hpc` and its 119
 * siblings.
 *
 * **One address, `0xde242`/`0xde244`, is shared by nineteen of the twenty
 * three sets at idx 14.** Not a decoding accident -- verified independently
 * per set, same address every time. Whatever idx 14 is, it is common to
 * almost every set rather than per-character, which reads as a shared
 * "neutral" or terminator sequence rather than 19 coincidences.
 *
 * **The debug print, read out of the entry block:**
 *
 *      mov r3, r6                     ; r3 = mode, saved before the format loads
 *      ldr r0, [pc, #N] ; add r0, pc  ; the format string
 *      mov r1, r4                     ; set
 *      mov r2, r5                     ; idx
 *      blx _printf
 *
 * `printf(fmt, set, idx, mode)` -- confirmed against the play-session log in
 * docs/PROGRESS.md, `seq_lookup( 18, 0, 1 )` and 365 lines like it: first
 * number is `set` (1-18 observed, this function accepts 0-22), second is
 * `idx`, third is `mode`, and `mode` is 1 in every one of the 366 lines
 * ever captured -- which is why nothing in this project has had reason to
 * read what a `mode` other than 1 would mean.
 *
 * The format string itself was read out of the literal pool byte for byte --
 * `"seq_lookup( %d, %d, %d );\n"`, at 0x0017c904 -- rather than assumed from
 * the log line's shape.
 *
 * **`landfn.sh` reports FALLA on this function, and it is the verifier that
 * is wrong, not the two lines below.** `printf` is this project's first call
 * to an imported C library function, and the first format string that
 * happens to spell its own function's name; both trip a real gap in
 * `factdiff.py`, written up as entry 7 of "Known gaps" in that file rather
 * than worked around here with something less faithful than the real call
 * and the real string. Every other fact in this function -- both switch
 * levels, all 449 table entries, the final `+ mode * 20` and the `NULL`
 * paths -- came back `1 coinciden` clean.
