# The font metrics format

Recovered from `limeCreateFONT` (armv6 `0x000af83c`) in the **armv6 slice**.
C in [`decomp/lime/limeFont.c`](../decomp/lime/limeFont.c).

A font is **two texture atlases and one metrics file**. The atlases are ordinary
textures loaded through `limeLoadTexture` with mode 2; everything structural
lives in the metrics file, and that file has **no magic number and no version
field**.

## Layout

```
offset  size            meaning
------  --------------  --------------------------------------------------
0       1               glyph count, low 8 bits
1       1               bit 0     : SIMPLE flag (stored inverted in the FONT)
                        bits 1..7 : glyph count high bits, read SIGNED then >>1
2       1               unidentified, kept at FONT+0x08
3       numGlyphs       character codes, one byte each

  --- if SIMPLE ---
        1               a single fallback advance for every glyph

  --- if not SIMPLE ---
        numGlyphs * W   metric array A          -> FONT+0x1c
        numGlyphs * W   metric array B          -> FONT+0x20
        numGlyphs * W   ADVANCE WIDTH           -> FONT+0x24

W is 1 or 2 -- see "The width is not in the file" below.
```

## The glyph count is packed across a stolen bit

```c
n = data[0] + (((int8_t)data[1] >> 1) << 8);
simple = ((data[1] & 1) != 0) ? 0 : 1;
```

The low bit of byte 1 is the flag, and the rest of the byte is the high half of
a **signed** count shifted down by one. Reading byte 1 as an unsigned count high
byte gives the right answer for every font under 128 glyphs and the wrong one
above it — which is a bug that passes every test on a Latin character set and
fails on Korean. The retail build ships Korean.

## The width is not in the file

The three metric arrays are read as **signed bytes or as halfwords depending on
an argument to `limeCreateFONT`**, not on anything in the data:

```
ldrsbeq  r3, [r5, r6]       ; narrow: signed byte
ldrhne   r1, [r5, r6]       ; wide:   halfword
addeq    r6, r6, #1
addne    r6, r6, #2
```

Both paths store `int16` at the destination. So **a metrics file does not
describe its own layout** — load it with the wrong flag and it parses cleanly
and produces garbage. Any external tool needs that flag from the call site.

## The advance is the THIRD array, not the second

`FONT+0x24` is the advance width — `ldr r1, [r4, #0x24]` at `0xaec48` is what
`limeGetStringWidth` accumulates. An earlier draft of this page put the advance
at `+0x20`, on nothing more than it being the middle of three. The read order in
`limeCreateFONT` is `+0x1c`, `+0x20`, `+0x24`, so the advance is the last array
read, and the first two remain unnamed because nothing recovered so far touches
them.

## The code table exists at two widths

The character codes are read once as bytes into `FONT+0x48`, and widened in the
same loop into `FONT+0x4c` as `{code, 0}` pairs — the identical codes as 16-bit
values. `limeGetStringWidth` searches one or the other depending on whether the
string turned out to be UTF-16.

That matters because **the encoding is detected at runtime, from a `0xFF 0xFE`
BOM**, inside the string functions themselves:

```
ldrsb    r3, [sl]
cmn      r3, #1              ; == 0xFF ?
ldrsbeq  r3, [sl, #1]
cmneq    r3, #2              ; == 0xFE ?
```

Both encodings travel as `const char *`. A port cannot decide from the type.

## Two fallbacks worth keeping

| Field | Value | When |
|---|---|---|
| `FONT+0x2c` | read from the file | SIMPLE fonts: one advance for all glyphs |
| `FONT+0x10` | the constant **8** | glyph count is zero |

`FONT+0x10` is written before the file is even opened, so **a font that fails to
load still measures text**, at 8 units per character. Menus come out misaligned
instead of collapsing to a point. Worth reproducing: it is the difference
between a visibly wrong screen and an invisible one.

## Measurement is scaled, not summed

`limeGetStringWidth` accumulates `FONT+0x20` as integers, then converts once and
multiplies by `FONT+0x14`, a value passed in at creation:

```
vcvt.f32.s32 s14, s15
vldr         s15, [r4, #0x14]
vmul.f32     s15, s14, s15
```

Metrics are stored in authoring units and scaled at measure time.

## What is still open

- **Byte 2 of the header** is kept at `FONT+0x08` and nothing decompiled so far
  reads it.
- **Two of the three metric arrays** (`FONT+0x1c` and `FONT+0x24`) are unused by
  the measurement path. For a texture-atlas font the natural pair is glyph
  position and glyph size, but neither function recovered so far touches them,
  so they are recorded by offset and deliberately left unnamed. `limeDrawFONT`
  is where they will resolve.
