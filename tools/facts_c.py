"""facts_c.py -- pull the SAME facts out of the readable decomp.

`facts_asm.py` reads the machine transcription and reports stores, calls,
handler targets and constants. This reads our own C and reports the same
things in the same vocabulary, so `factdiff.py` can put the two lists side by
side without either side knowing about the other.

## Why this one can be simple

The house style is regular, and that regularity is the whole reason a checker
is cheap here:

    obj->field1c = 3;                     a store into MK3OBJ at 0x1c
    obj->field00->field58 = 3;            a store into MK3OBJPROC at 0x58
    thread->fieldfc = 1;                  a store into MK3THREAD at 0xfc
    group_sound(obj);                     a call
    mk3_install(thread, (MK3THREADFUNC)t_jhp5)        a handler
    mk3_frame(thread, thread->frame)[1] = ...t_jhp5;  the same, spelled out
    *mk3_frame(thread, thread->frame + 1) = 0x807;    a state token
    return -3;                            the refusal

`mk3logic.h` supplies the offsets. A field spelled `fieldNN` carries its own
offset in its name; the ones with real names -- `a10`, `him`, `slave`, `frame`
-- carry it in the `/* 0xNN` comment beside them. Both are read, per struct,
because 0x44 is `a10` in MK3OBJ and `p_hit` in MK3OBJPROC and confusing the
two would invent a difference that is not there.

## What it deliberately does not do

It does not evaluate expressions. `obj->field1c = obj->field48;` reports a
store of `?`, not of whatever field48 held, for the same reason `facts_asm.py`
reports `?` rather than carrying a stale constant: a wrong fact stated with
confidence is worse than no fact. The diff treats `?` on either side as "not
compared" and says so in its summary, so the pair that cannot be checked is
visible rather than silently counted as agreement.

## What it does not read yet

Each of these shows up as a phantom difference until it is fixed, so anyone
adding to this file should check the list before chasing a report:

  * a loop. `for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) find_part2(obj);` reports ONE call where
    the binary has five unrolled. Reading the bound would fix it.
  * a store through a global: `*(uint32_t *)(G_BYTES + 0x378 + p * 4) = 0`.
    Nothing reached through `G` or `H` is checked at all.
  * a value that is an expression rather than a literal or a name. Following
    one level of copy -- `obj->field1c = obj->field48;` -- would recover a
    good many of the `?`.
  * a store statement split across more than one physical line. `RE_STORE`
    is anchored on one line including its own `;`, so `obj->field5c =` with
    the right-hand side starting on the NEXT line matched nothing at all --
    not even a `?` -- and the store vanished from the C's own fact list
    with no trace. `facts_of` now joins forward until it sees a `;` before
    giving up on a line that looks like a store's left side. Found in
    `proj_onscreen_test`/`proj_onscreen_test_unsafe` (mkzap.c).
  * `X = (cond) ? A : B;`. Once the line-join above stopped losing it
    entirely, this still read as one `value()` on the whole expression --
    `?`, always, one unit of slack. That undercounts a real two-way branch:
    `proj_onscreen_test` compiles to two actual `str`s (0 and 1, on two
    paths) and needed two units to clear. But `is_he_motaro`, same C shape
    one file over, compiles to ONE conditional-move with no branch at all --
    a single unresolved store on the binary side. Nothing in the C syntax
    says which the compiler chose, so a ternary-valued store now emits `?`
    TWICE (`RE_TERNARY`), giving up to two units of slack either way rather
    than asserting 0 and 1 as if the branch were guaranteed.

## The rule that keeps it honest

A name is a fact only when the symbol table has it. Everything else is `?`.
This file used to report `below` and `carried` -- locals invented here to
hold what the binary keeps in a register -- as though they were values, and
every one came out as a difference against a binary that has no such thing.
