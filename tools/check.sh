# A naive `for f in $(find . -name '*.c')` sweep is WRONG here and reported a
# phantom error for a while: it compiled the Linux backend on Windows without
# SDL2 and called the missing header a defect. CMake never builds that file on
# Windows. So this script picks the backend the way CMakeLists.txt does.
#
# The off-platform backend is then linted separately rather than skipped,
# because a file nobody compiles is a file where a typo lives forever. It uses
# a real SDL2 when one is installed and tests/sdl2-lint/SDL.h when not -- and
# says which, because only the first of those is a real check.
#
#   sh tools/check.sh
#
# Exit status is the number of errors, so CI can use it directly.

# Not a compiler check -- a source-hygiene one, and it has caught real damage.
# Writing a file through an UNQUOTED shell heredoc makes the shell interpret
# backslash escapes, so a comment that MENTIONS an escape sequence lands in the
# file as the literal control byte instead. decomp/lime/RenderMesh.c carried a
# NUL inside a comment for a long time: the compiler is perfectly happy with it
# and grep just reports the file as binary, so nothing complained.
#
# Write source with a QUOTED heredoc or an editor tool, never an unquoted one.
