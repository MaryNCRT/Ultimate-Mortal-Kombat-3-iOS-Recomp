annotate.py -- disassemble a function with everything resolved.

Raw disassembly of this binary is unreadable in five separate ways, and each
needs a different lookup:

  1. `bl #0x127974`          an import stub      -> tools/stubs.py has the name
  2. `bl #0x55388`           an INTERNAL call    -> the symbol table has it
  3. `ldr r0, [pc, #0x2c]`   a literal pool      -> read the four bytes
  4. `ldr rN, [pc, #M]` then `add rN, pc`        -> a PC-RELATIVE ADDRESS
  5. ...then `ldr rM, [rN]`                      -> that address is a POINTER
                                                    SLOT and the value it holds
                                                    is what the code is after

The fourth and fifth are what this tool exists for, and they are why an earlier
version of it was nearly useless. It only understood the three-operand
`add rN, pc, rN`; the compiler emits the two-operand `add rN, pc` almost
everywhere, so the interesting addresses came out as bare literals like
`0x000d6dfa` and got resolved by hand, one at a time, in every batch.

The fifth case is the same hand work one level deeper. `getTransferableFlags`
computes 0x000f357c, which the symbol table calls `___utf16_string_11+0x4e7a`
and which is therefore not a string at all -- it is a slot holding 0x0038c1fc,
and THAT is `_G`, the game state. Three lookups deep, and only the last one
means anything.

    python tools/annotate.py work/UMK3.armv7 _getTransferableFlags
    python tools/annotate.py work/UMK3.armv7 _LIME_RenderMeshSingle --calls

`--calls` prints only the lines that resolved to something, which is usually
what you want first.

The symbol table comes from $UMK3_SYMBOLS, or work/symbols.txt.

## An exact symbol match is worth more than a near one

`_G` and `___utf16_string_11+0x4e7a` are both "the symbol at that address", but
only the first is a fact about the variable; the second means the address fell
between two symbols and the nearest preceding one is being reported. Near
matches are marked `(near)` and should be treated as a hint, not a name.

## A gap, stated rather than hidden

It does not carry a literal across a register copy. `areAchievementsViewing`
loads its base into r1 once and does `mov r3, r1 ; add r3, pc` inside the loop,
so its address does not resolve and has to be worked out by hand -- the exact
thing this tool exists to avoid. An attempt at it did not fire and was removed
rather than left in place looking as though it worked; a tool that silently
resolves some cases and not others is worse than one with a known limit.

The shape to look for: an `add rN, pc` whose register was last written by a
`mov` rather than by an `ldr [pc, ...]`.

## One thing this tool still cannot do for you

It annotates each instruction where it stands. It does **not** pair a literal
with the call that consumes it, because the compiler interleaves them: in
`LIME_RenderMeshSingle` a `GL_VERTEX_ARRAY` is loaded immediately before a
`glClientActiveTexture`, which does not take that enum. The value belongs to a
later call and the register was simply free.

So read the annotations as "these constants appear in this function", not as
"this call takes this argument". Getting that wrong writes a confident and
false comment, which is the failure mode this whole project is built to avoid.
The way to settle a pairing is to RUN the function -- see tests/gl_trace.c.
