"""instck.py -- is this install allowed to refuse?

`mk3_push_handler` is the whole state-0 shape: it REFUSES with -3 when the
token slot is not clear, and only then replaces the handler. That is right for
a routine whose one state is entry -- those write the guard inline and the
binary really does test the slot. It is wrong for the later states of a
dispatcher, whose token is non-zero by construction: there the binary stores
the handler with no test at all, so a guard we emit is a refusal the game
never makes.

The audit is source-level on purpose. It cannot prove a site wrong -- only the
disassembly does that -- but it points at the sites worth re-reading, and the
class it finds is one no compiler and no prototype check can see.
