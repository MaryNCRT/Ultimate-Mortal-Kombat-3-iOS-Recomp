"""Honest progress count for the decompiled modules.

A function counts as done only if `decomp/` holds a real body for it.

Three modules are counted, each the same way: `lime/common`, `gamecode`, and
`gamecode/logic`. They are separated because they are separate rows in the
README's table and separate bodies of work -- the fight engine is eight times
the size of the rest of gamecode and nothing useful is learned by averaging
them together.

## How a symbol is matched to a C function

By its **Itanium length prefix**, not by trimming type codes off the end.
`__Z36CreateMatrixPaletteForGeneratingMeshPclllfP9BONESINFO` says the identifier
is 36 characters long, so it is exactly `CreateMatrixPaletteForGeneratingMesh`
and everything after it is argument encoding. That is unambiguous.

The earlier version guessed instead, stripping suffixes with a regexp, and it
mismatched anything whose type codes it had not anticipated -- `Pclllf` and
`PhPcfl11limeVECTOR3` among them. It undercounted by two. An older variant of
the same bug undercounted by seven and put three wrong figures in the README.

## The overall figure is measured, not asserted

Five of the eight blocks in the README's table are judgement calls about work
that is not function-counted -- analysis, tooling, format specifications, the
platform rewrite, the SDK stubs. Those stay as numbers a person maintains.

The other three are counted from the tree on every run. They used to be
hardcoded here too, and `gamecode` sat at 0% and `gamecode/logic` at 4% long
after both had real verified bodies committed. A progress script that has to be
edited by hand to reflect progress is a progress script that will be wrong, and
this one is specifically the place this project put its "suspect the counter"
rule.

## What is deliberately excluded

  lime_unimplemented.c  -- bodies that only call abort(). They exist so the
                           linker is satisfied; counting them reports work that
                           has not been done. This script counted them once and
                           jumped from 88 to 93 with nothing written, which is
                           the failure the ENCARGO warns about.
  lime_globals.c        -- data, not functions.

Reads work/func-to-file.txt, or UMK3_FUNC_TO_FILE if that is set.
