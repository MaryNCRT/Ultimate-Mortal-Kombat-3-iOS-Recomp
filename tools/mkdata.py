"""mkdata.py -- recover the initial value of every global from the binary.

`mkglobals.py` gives each global storage. Storage is not enough: 498 of the 779
globals it emits live in `__DATA,__data`, which is the section for data that is
**initialised in the image**, and giving those zero is not a neutral default --
it is the wrong value. A zeroed `IdlesPerPlayer` is a null frame list. A zeroed
`SoundList` is a list of unnamed sounds. A zeroed button table is a menu whose
every control sits at the origin.

So this reads what the linker actually put there.

    vmaddr = file offset + 0x1000

is the whole mapping, verified for this binary, and it means the bytes behind
any global are `binary[addr - 0x1000 : ...]`. The extent comes from the symbol
table the same way `mkglobals.py` measures arrays: the gap to the next symbol.

## Why this emits C and not a blob

Copying the bytes into memory at startup would run, and it would be useless.
A word in this data is one of two things and the difference does not survive a
`memcpy`:

    0x3f800000      the float 1.0
    0x0017118c      the ADDRESS of Player_KANO_Idles

A 32-bit image's pointers are 4 bytes; the host's are 8. Blit the table and
every pointer in it is garbage. Emit `&Player_KANO_Idles` and the host linker
computes the right address for its own word size -- and the output says what
the value MEANS, which a hex dump never does.

That is also why a word that looks like an address inside an integer-typed
global is reported rather than emitted: it is the signature of a declaration
that has the wrong type, and `IdlesPerPlayer` -- declared `long *[]` when the
first word of each pair is a float -- was found exactly this way.

## What it does not do

A struct with no body in the decomp cannot be initialised, because the field
offsets are unknown; `BUTTONNEW` is forward-declared only, and its 26 globals
are listed at the end of the run for whoever writes that struct. Multi-
dimensional arrays are emitted flat only when C allows it. Everything skipped is
counted and named, never silently dropped.
