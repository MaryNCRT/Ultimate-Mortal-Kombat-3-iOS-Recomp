"""logic_tables.py -- extract the fight engine's data tables from the user's binary.

    python tools/logic_tables.py <UMK3 binary> <out.c> [--report <out.txt>]

`decomp/gamecode/logic` is code. The data it runs on -- special-move lists,
animation scripts, reaction tables, AI branch tables, ~1,100 objects in all --
lives in the binary's __DATA,__data and __TEXT,__const and is NOT in this
repository. This tool reads it out of the user's own copy at build time and
writes a C file that defines every one of those objects, so the decompiled
engine links and runs. The generated file holds game data: it belongs in the
build directory and is never committed.

## Which objects

The binary is not stripped, and its STABs say which source file defined each
global and each function-local static (`N_SO` opens a file, `N_GSYM`/`N_STSYM`
name its data, `N_FUN` its functions). Every data object of every
`src/gamecode/logic/*.c` file is emitted.

Zero-filled ones (__common: `G`, `H`, `Plyr`, `mytc` ...) are emitted as
storage under `umk3_common_<name>`, unless the map lists them as `object`.
The decompiled code does not name most of them directly -- it goes through
slot pointers (`char *Plyr`,
`GAMESTATE *G`) that `runtime/fight_runtime.c` points at this storage -- but
tables do: `swtab` holds addresses inside `G`, and those must land in the
same bytes the slot reaches.

## How big each one is

The gap to the next symbol in the same section. Anonymous objects -- the
string literals behind `txt_tie`, for instance -- sit in that gap and come
along with the object before them, at the same relative offset, which is what
a pointer into them needs.

## Which words are pointers

The binary is not position-independent, so there is no rebase table to say.
A word is relocated when, and only when:

  * it is a Thumb function start (bit 0 set) of a function whose STAB places
    it in a gamecode/logic source file -- every function of which has a native
    definition; or
  * it falls inside one of the emitted logic data objects; or
  * it falls inside an object `logic_tables.map` maps to native storage.

and it is not listed as `int` in `logic_tables.map`.

Anything else is an integer and is copied as is. That rule is deliberately
narrow: the special-move lists hold switch masks such as 0x00200000 that land
inside front-end objects, and fixed-point constants such as 0x00050000 land in
the middle of functions. Neither is a pointer, and the rule does not take
them for one. Every relocation and every rejected near-miss is written to the
report so the classification can be audited.

## `int` entries: words checked to be numbers

A value can land inside a logic object by accident. `ochar_headrip_lineups`
is read as `int16_t` pairs by mkfatal.c, and its pair (0x0030, 0x000e) spells
0x000e0030, which is inside `seq_mileena_groundroll`. The map lists each such
word, by symbol and offset, with the read that settles it. A listed word is
never relocated, and the generator refuses a listed word that would not have
been relocated anyway, so a stale entry cannot hide.

## Layout

Every object is emitted in binary address order into one section, zero-filled
ones included (a zero array would otherwise go to .bss and leave the order).
Objects whose address or size is not a multiple of four are emitted as bytes,
at their exact size and alignment; one of those holding a relocation is an
error. So two objects that touch in the image touch on the host, and a read
past the end of one sees the next, as it does on the device:
`ochar_slam_damage` is 25 int16 indexed by character, and sits directly in
front of `ochar_slammed_anis`.

## Pointer width

The generated arrays hold `uintptr_t` and the file refuses to compile unless
that is four bytes: the engine's structs are 32-bit, and so are its tables.
