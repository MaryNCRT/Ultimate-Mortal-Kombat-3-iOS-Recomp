"""handlercheck.py -- do the handlers our C names match the ones the binary loads?

`factdiff.py` cannot answer this for a large class of handlers. A handler the
binary fetches through a __DATA pointer slot (`ldr r3,[pc,#n]; add r3,pc;
ldr r2,[r3]`) comes out of the machine transcription as `?`, and a `?` is
slack, not a disagreement. So a slot resolved to the wrong routine by hand --
or two slots read the wrong way round -- still verifies.

That happened. In mkboss.c, slots 0x000f3418 and 0x000f3428 were once
labelled `t_motaro_slided` and `t_d_block`; they hold `t_d_block` and
`t_return_to_beware`, and four functions installed the wrong routines. Slot
0x000f33fc was read as `t_d_beware` in five more; it holds `t_d_stance_pause`.
Every one of them came back OK from landfn.sh.

This reads each function's disassembly, resolves every address it loads --
dereferencing pointer slots through the image -- and every `bl` target, and
checks two things against the C body:

    forward   each routine the binary loads is named somewhere in the C
    reverse   each routine the C installs, pushes or casts to a pointer is
              one the binary actually loads

A hit is not proof of a bug -- a comment mentioning a name satisfies the
forward check, and a literal that travels further than an `ldr` and a
`mov` before its `add pc` is still missed. Check a hit against the
disassembly before changing anything.
