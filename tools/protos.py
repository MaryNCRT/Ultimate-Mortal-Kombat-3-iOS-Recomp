"""protos.py -- every declaration must match the definition it refers to.

`check.sh` compiles each file on its own, so a prototype that contradicts a
definition in ANOTHER file is invisible to it: both compile, and only the
linker would notice -- and only for the return type, never for the arguments.
That is how `rsnd_func` came to have three different prototypes in three
files, one of which passed a pointer where the definition took an integer.

The definition wins. It was read from the disassembly; a declaration is
somebody's note about a function they were calling.

Exit status is the number of disagreements, so it can gate a build.
