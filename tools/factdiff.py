"""factdiff.py -- put the two fact lists side by side and name what differs.

`facts_asm.py` reads the machine transcription of a function; `facts_c.py`
reads ours. Neither knows about the other. This compares them and reports, per
function, the things a transcription gets wrong.

## Multisets, not sequences

The two are compared as MULTISETS rather than in order, on purpose. The
readable C is allowed to say the same thing in a different order -- an
`if/else` where the binary has a branch and a fall-through, a `goto pop` where
the binary repeats the tail four times -- and comparing sequences would report
every one of those as a difference. What cannot legitimately differ is WHICH
stores happen, WITH WHAT values, to WHICH routines control passes, and what
comes back.

So four comparisons:

    stores    (offset, value) where both sides resolved the value
    handlers  the routines installed into the frame
    tokens    the state numbers written into the frame
    calls     which routines are called, and how many times

## `?` is not a disagreement

Either side reports `?` when it will not guess. A pair where one side is `?`
is counted as UNCHECKED and reported separately rather than folded into either
column, because calling it agreement would be the same overclaiming the tools
were built to avoid. The summary prints that count; a function with many of
them has been checked less than its verdict suggests.

## THE FIRST RUN OF A CHECKER MEASURES THE CHECKER

Read this before trusting a number out of here, and before improving it.

On `joy.c` the verdict went 17 -> 22 -> 42 -> 58 -> 67 of 73 across five
rounds, and not one line of decomp changed in between. Every jump was a false
positive in the readers:

    a local reported as a fact       `below`, `carried`, `sel` are names this
                                     project invented for a value the binary
                                     keeps in a register; they are `?` now
    one side`s unknown made a diff   the binary fetches some handlers through
                                     a pointer table and will not follow it;
                                     that is not evidence against ours
    calls only matched as statements every call inside an `if` was invisible
    `if` counted as a call           `if (obj->field5c != 0)` matched
    mk3_push_handler unrecognised    despite the name it installs, so every
                                     retraction proc read as installing nothing
    calls needing `obj` first        random32() and MKEvent_Add() invisible
    names needing a lowercase start  MKEvent_Add, ReallyKillProjectile too

So: a difference this tool reports is a QUESTION, not a verdict. Read the
disassembly before touching the decomp, every time. The failure that matters
here is not missing a defect -- it is reporting one that is not there and
sending somebody to "fix" correct code.

## Known gaps, in the order they are worth closing

1. **`plyrthread` and anything its size.** 95 of its facts come back `?` and
   the readers give up on its length. A function this big needs the diff done
   per BLOCK rather than per function; as it stands its verdict means little.
2. **Loops.** `for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) find_part2(obj);` is one call here and
   five in the binary. Two of joy.c`s six remaining differences are exactly
   this and neither is a defect. A count taken from the loop bound would fix
   both.
3. **Stores through a global.** `*(uint32_t *)(G_BYTES + 0x378 + p * 4) = 0`
   is not read at all on the C side, so the turbo bar and everything else
   reached through `G` or `H` goes unchecked.
4. **Values that are expressions.** `obj->field1c = obj->field48;` is `?`
   on both sides. Following one level of copy would recover a good many.
5. **Jump tables.** A `switch` the compiler emitted as `tbb` -- a byte table
   of branch offsets indexed by a register -- has every case branching into
   ONE shared store, so the asm side reports a single handler with an
   unresolved value and the readable C reports one per case. Every one of
   those cases then comes out as "the C has a handler the binary does not".
   `t_background_death` in mkreact.c is the first; a reading of the table
   itself would fix it, and until then such a function has to say in its
   banner that it was checked by hand.
6. **Flow facts.** After `cbz r6`, r6 is zero on that path -- the binary
   gets a constant from a branch rather than from a load, and the asm reader
   does not. Several `?` on the asm side are this one case.
7. **Calls to imported functions, and the string literals that quote them.**
   `facts_asm.py`'s `RE_CALL` only matches `func_XXXXXXXX_name(ctx);` --
   recomp.py's shape for a call to a function it found in the symbol table
   with an address. A call to an unresolved import comes out as
   `stub_printf(ctx);` instead (no address, no `func_` prefix) and this
   reader never sees it, so a real `printf(...)` in the readable C reports
   as "the C has a call the binary does not" even when the call is right.
   `facts_c.py`'s `RE_CALL` has the matching problem from the other side: it
   is a bare `name` + whitespace + `(` scan with no idea what is a string
   literal, so a
   format string that happens to spell the function's own name --
   `printf("seq_lookup( %d, %d, %d );\n", ...)` inside `seq_lookup` itself --
   reads as a call to `seq_lookup`. `playback.c`'s `seq_lookup` is the first
   function in this project to call an imported C library function, which is
   why neither gap had shown up before it.

## What it will never do

Prove the English in a banner. The Godot port`s claim that the engine
interpolates between consecutive frames was false, cost a day, and no
instruction-level check would have caught it. A sentence about what the
engine does needs an address beside it and the address needs reading.
