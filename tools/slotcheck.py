"""slotcheck.py -- find globals the decomp declares as both a slot and a value.

The same symbol gets declared in every file that touches it, and the two
spellings can disagree:

    FrontEnd.c:  extern float *GameCounter;   /* pointer slot */
    GameCode.c:  extern float  GameCounter;   /* 0x0014fa5c */

Both compile, because each translation unit only sees its own. One of them is
wrong, and the wrong one crashes: `*GameCounter` reads the bits of a float as an
address. This has now been the cause of three separate faults --
`AllFramesTable`, `FatalityMessage`, `GameCounter` -- so it is worth a tool
rather than another afternoon.

## What settles it

The address in the comment is the SYMBOL's address, and the symbol table says
how big that symbol is and what section it lives in. A genuine pointer slot is
a GOT entry: the compiler emits

    ldr r3, [pc, #..]     ; -> 0x000f35f4      the slot
    ldr r3, [r3]                               the address it holds

and every one of those lives in the 0x000f3xxx region. An address outside that
region is the data itself, so a four-byte symbol there is a value and spelling
it `T *` is wrong.

    python tools/slotcheck.py           report
    python tools/slotcheck.py --fix     correct the ones it is sure of

`--fix` only touches the "value" verdict: a symbol of four bytes or fewer,
outside the GOT region, declared `T *name` in one file and `T name` in another.
There the pointer spelling cannot be right and the correction is mechanical --
drop the star on the declaration, and drop it from `*name` at the use sites in
that same file. It does not touch arrays: those need a look at how each site
indexes them.

Nothing is lost by being wrong in the safe direction here. `mkglobals.py`
already gives these symbols value storage, because it prefers the sized
declaration, so every `*name` in the tree is ALREADY reading a float or a long
as an address. The fix makes the source agree with what is generated.
